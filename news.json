Here's what you need to know", "time": "Mon 15 Apr 2019 ", "category": "World", "tags": "Indonesia,Asia Pacific,Joko Widodo,explainers", "content": "A nation made up of 17,000 islands, will hold the biggest, most complex one-day elections in the world on 17 April. The elections in India are bigger in number but are held over a comparatively relaxed period of six weeks.A total of 192.8 million Indonesians are registered to vote with more than half aged 40 or under in what is the world’s third-largest democracy after India and the US.In a country where democracy is also relatively young, elections are a colourful and celebratory affair, described locally as “”, or “democracy party”.The vote will be the world’s biggest direct presidential election (the US has an indirect electoral college system), and this year the voting process is even more gargantuan and complicated than normal, with presidential and parliamentary elections being held on the same day for the first time.That means that at 809,500 polling stations, Indonesian voters will be choosing from more than 250,000 candidates for 20,538 legislative seats at five levels of government over a period of just six hours.While voters will be marking five boxes on their ballot papers, much of the focus is on the presidential race.The incumbent is , better known as “Jokowi”, a former furniture businessman turned politician from Java, flanked by his vice-presidential running mate Ma’ruf Amin, a 76-year-old conservative Islamic cleric.Jokowi is up against Prabowo Subianto, , and former son-in-law of Indonesia’s long-time leader Suharto. He has teamed up with Sandiaga Uno, a wealthy former investment banker who was briefly deputy governor of Jakarta.Essentially this vote is a rematch between two political rivals. In the bitterly divisive presidential election of 2014, Jokowi defeated Prabowo by six percentage points.All Indonesians aged 17 or over who hold an electronic identification card, known as an e-KTP, have the right to vote. Those who are married can vote at a younger age – the legal age for girls to marry is 16. The only groups excluded from voting are police and military officers, who by law are obliged to stay politically neutral.The electronic identity card requirement means that some in remote or underdeveloped areas will miss out. In Indonesia’s easternmost province of Papua, for example, less than 50% of eligible voters have an electronic identity card, according to the Indonesia’s home affairs ministry. In other areas more than 1.6 million indigenous people may not be able to vote for the same reason.Uniquely, in some mountainous regions of Papua, some tribes employ a voting bloc system known as , in which a tribal chief represents the communal voice of the tribe. Ballots are placed inside a , a traditional woven bag, and the chief votes on their behalf.With ballot papers to Indonesia’s most far-flung regions delivered by plane, warship, horseback, canoe and even on foot, the sheer logistics are impressive. And inevitably there are a few hiccups.Last week a vessel carrying 26 sacks of ballot papers sank en route to Natuna, a regency made up of several hundred islands in the South China Sea, after it hit some coral.There is also concern over alleged , with the opposition claiming that 17 million voters are registered with the same three birthdays, while absurdly others are marked as born in the first century AD. The election commission is investigating the claims, similar to allegations thrown out by Indonesia’s constitutional court in 2014.Despite research that points to attempts at rampant vote buying, Indonesia’s elections are viewed as relatively free and fair, with election monitors from 33 countries invited to observe.Indonesians are also fierce defenders of their democracy – with many voters remaining at their polling stations during the last election to watch the count."},

The whole process occurs underwater to prevent radiation leaks. The utility plans to repeat the procedure in the two other reactors that suffered meltdowns.The work began a day after the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, pledged to revive neighbourhoods evacuated after the meltdown during his first visit to  Daiichi for more than five years.“Our basic policy is that every minister is a reconstruction minister,” Abe said, days after Yoshitaka Sakurada, the minister in charge of Fukushima’s recovery, was  after suggesting that the career of a local politician was more important than rebuilding the region affected by the tsunami.“We have reaffirmed our commitment to work for the revival of Fukushima and northeastern ,” Abe said, adding that the government “stood at the forefront” of decommissioning work, which is expected to take at least 40 years.Earlier in the day Abe visited Okuma, one of two towns that host the nuclear plant, days after its . But so far only 367 people, or 3.5% of Okuma’s pre-disaster population of 10,341, have registered as residents, according to Kyodo news agency.In 2014, workers  in reactor building No 4, which was one of three reactors not in operation when the plant was struck by a towering tsunami.Preparations for the work that began on Monday underlined the challenges facing Tepco as it attempts to devise ways to remove melted fuel from inside the damaged reactors.The removal of the fuel rods was delayed by more than four years due to equipment malfunctions, high radiation levels in the reactor building and radioactive debris from a hydrogen explosion that occurred in the immediate aftermath of the triple meltdown.The work is being carried out remotely from a control room about 500 metres away due to high radiation levels inside the reactor building.Robotic probes have  in all three reactors that suffered meltdowns, but experts have yet to develop robots capable of locating and removing the fuel while exposed to dangerously high radiation levels.In February a probe made physical contact with melted fuel at the bottom of a reactor for the first time since the disaster."},

Yet many are still waiting to be airlifted to safety two years or more after applying for the scheme. Many have been forced to live in hidingas a result.Resettlement schemes are considered the pinnacle of sanctuary options and people fleeing danger are accepted in  to come to the UK. Other safe countries including France, Germany, Norway and Sweden participate in similar schemes. LGBT refugee friends of the 15 challenging the Home Office typically only waited three to five months after applying before they were brought to safety in those countries.While delays are difficult for all refugees, the LGBT group says that because of homophobic discrimination and attacks in Turkey they are at particular risk and have been forced to lead double lives and to hide in “safehouses”.Same-sex relationships are legal in Turkey but homophobic attitudes prevail and many LGBT refugees have reported being pelted by rocks, followed in the street and attacked if people suspect they are not heterosexual.There have been murders of LGBT people in Turkey including of gay Syrian refugee Wisam Sankara in July 2016 and Turkish trans woman  just weeks later.LGBT Syrian refugees in Turkey are concerned about the risk from the population at large but also from their own families who often don’t know about their sexual identity. The 15 refugees bringing the action against the Home Office say that gay men and trans women are in particular danger.One, who is hiding from his family who discovered that he is gay, spoke to the Guardian from a safe house in Istanbul: “I can’t live in this country any more. I feel that at any moment my family could find me and kill me,” he said. “I’m gay but I can’t say I’m gay. You can’t even look at a man in the street here. It’s high-level dangerous.“One LGBTQ+ Syrian refugee I know has been waiting more than two years for the UK Home Office to bring him to safety. He has been stabbed twice because of his sexuality.” He said all 15 feel abandoned by the Home Office.A volunteer who has been supporting LGBT Syrian refugees in Istanbul has asked not to be named for fear of identifying the people she is supporting. She said: “During my time here I have seen how dangerous life is for all LGBTQ Syrian refugees. They are isolated individuals in a homophobic country. I have witnessed discrimination, harassment and physical violence against them. One trans person I know was held hostage as a sex slave for several days until she managed to escape. In 2017 a member of this community was murdered and decapitated.”She added that it was particularly hard for the 15 to see LGBT refugee friends leaving Turkey to start new lives in other countries’ resettlement schemes.“It’s always the same UK group waving them off at the bus wondering when it’s their turn.”In their legal action the 15 refugees claim that government officials are subjecting them to inhuman and degrading treatment and breaching human rights law. They are calling on the Home Office to take “immediate steps” to sort the issue out. They told the Guardian that the situation is extremely urgent and that they are in constant danger.Toufique Hossain and Sheroy Zaq of Duncan Lewis solicitors, who are representing the 15 LGBT refugees, said: “We met these brave individuals in Istanbul. Having fled their homes in , their hope was finally for a life where they could be themselves and live freely.“Their stories are truly heartbreaking. We really do hope that the Home Office expedites these applications without the need for further litigation. They’ve known of the urgency for quite some time. They must act swiftly.”A refugee waiting to get to the UK said: “In Syria we saw a lot and went through a lot. In Turkey we are in danger again. We must hide all the time. We are told: ‘Just wait, your file is with the Home Office.’ Everyone has his own dream: to love, to study, to marry, to have rights. The most important thing is to be safe and then we can start to think about these things.”A Home Office spokesman said: “We do not routinely comment on individual cases.” Home Office sources said it can take time to find suitable placements to meet the specific needs of individuals."},

Hundreds of Serbs were killed in retaliatory attacks.“We have to sit down even with our arch enemies, but without any preconditions, and try to listen to each other,” Hashim Thaçi, the Kosovan president, told the Guardian in an interview ahead of a conference in Berlin on 29 April. Talks between the two countries have been suspended since November, when Kosovo imposed 100% tariffs on goods from . Thaçi said there was no plan to lift the tariffs, but stressed the need for quick progress.International hesitancy and mixed messages were “creating space for nationalists and populists on both sides of the border”, he said. “Too often it boils down to big egos and clashes of personalities, and we hear too rarely about principles, standards and values.”Thaçi said he had invested all the political capital he had built up over two decades in the success of the talks, and the price of continued failure would be damage to the whole region.“In current circumstances, with these tensions, I do not see why any foreign investors would come and invest in our region. Only a peace agreement will bring prosperity,” he said.Kosovo’s current halfway-house status, where it is  and not others, means its citizens are the only Europeans west of Belarus who require a visa to travel to the Schengen area. These restrictions do not apply elsewhere in the Balkans. A third of Kosovo’s workforce are jobless.Thaçi, a former head of the  Liberation Army, which fought for independence, blamed some EU member states for complicating the process, a reference to the way in which Germany, unlike the US, has opposed aspects of Thaçi’s proposals, especially on what he has described as “border corrections”. for the predominantly Serbian region in northern Kosovo surrounding Mitrovica to join Serbia, and the mostly ethnic Albanian Preševo valley to be transferred to Kosovo. In practice, the north Kosovo region operates a form of dual sovereignty, with influence from Kosovo and Serbia.Thaçi was an advocate of the territory swap, but it has been opposed by Germany, which fears it might fuel semi-dormant demands for other geographical borders in the Balkans, including in Serb-dominated parts of Bosnia, to be redrawn on ethnic lines. The US, with which Thaçi is close, is more open-minded about the plan.Thaçi said “border demarcation” would be part of any comprehensive mutual recognition agreement. But he stressed “there can be no borders on ethnic lines. It’s impossible. Both Kosovo and Serbia will remain multi-ethnic states.”In late 2018, Kosovo imposed 100% tariffs on Serbian goods and said Serbia had insisted on their removal as a precondition for restarting talks. The imposition of the tariffs led to the resignation of four mayors in provinces in northern Kosovo.“Kosovan Serbs have withdrawn from political life in Kosovo, including the police and judiciary in the north of Kosovo,” Thaçi said. “Nobody has an answer how to move forward and the biggest victims are Kosovans, and in particular, Kosovan Serbs.”"},

{"title": "Alberta election key test for Rachel Notley and carbon tax", "time": "Mon 15 Apr 2019 ", "category": "Americas", "tags": "Canada,Americas,news", "content": "When Canada’s leftwing New Democratic party launched a manifesto promising carbon taxes, coal plant closures and welfare spending in the heartland of country’s oil industry, few thought they could win.But in 2015, the party ended 40 years of conservative rule in the province of Alberta with an unexpected victory .Four years later, the NDP leader, Rachel Notley, is fighting for her political life in a regional election forcing voters to make a choice between today’s economy or the environment of the future.Notley is asking voters to believe that both economy and environment can thrive. But her main rival, Jason Kenney, has seized on deep economic frustrations, promising that his United Conservative party will breathe new life into the ailing oil industry.In the years since Notley became premier, she has been forced to navigate a crash in global oil prices –  – and a huge forest fire, which became the . Meanwhile, her spending on childcare and social welfare programs have left the historically debt-averse province in the red.“People like and respect Rachel Notley,” said Shauna Wilton, a professor of political science at the University of Alberta. “But there’s a segment of the population that blames her for the oil downturn and sees the carbon tax as the source of all of Alberta’s problems.”An ongoing energy crisis has forced Alberta to sell its crude oil for . Pipelines that were promised to residents . And resource companies – the backbone of the province’s economy – are shedding jobs.And while voters have been sympathetic to the hand Notley was dealt, the dramatic slowdown has tested even the province’s progressive residents.“I’m a social worker and a yogi. I’m as left as they come,” said Cheryl, a mother of two who lives in a small town near Calgary. “And I’m very likely voting for the United Conservative party.”has the New Democrats nearly ten percentage points behind United Conservatives, which was born from the 2017 merge of two regional right-of-centre parties.Kenney’s pledge to boost investment in the oil industry resonates for many in the region, . “The rates of domestic violence skyrocket when people are not working,” said Cheryl. But  whether a return to the heyday of oil sands expansion is even possible, given the likelihood of a global shift to renewable energy in coming decades.“We should be diversifying our economy for the next time a downturn hits,” said Mark Mielke, corporate lawyer in Calgary who plans to vote for the NDP, “not cutting taxes for corporations.”The prospect of a conservative victory has also prompted worries that progress made on the environment under Notley will be rolled back – a fear compounded by a recent report that found at a rate twice the global average.Alberta – by far the largest polluter in the country – has been a critical ally for the , and his government in their  to fight climate change.But Alberta’s cooperation came with a cost: in exchange for a carbon tax, Notley wanted promises of support for construction of the contentious TransMountain pipeline running from Alberta’s oil sands to the Pacific coast.Despite the federal government going as far as , the pipeline and Notley has been forced to shoulder much of the blame.In an attempt to assuage local frustration, the premier has taken unprecedented steps to prop up oil prices – buying locomotives to ship crude by rail and  for energy companies. There is some hope for environmentally conscious voters: attempts by Kenney to scale back the carbon tax would probably trigger a bitter fight with federal government, which has a  a province must meet.Meanwhile, Kenney has come under criticism for his seeming inability to rid his party of . Kenney’s troubles became evident in a  with the conservative radio host Charles Adler. As Adler ran through a list of offensive and racist behaviour from numerous UCP candidates – and even by , he asked the conservative leader: “Why are the knuckle-draggers attracted to your party?”Several UCP candidates have  in recent weeks and others have been forced to walk back xenophobic and homophobic statements – including  homosexual love isn’t “real love” and compared women who had have abortions to murderers.Such incidents, however, have done little to derail Kenney’s prospects in rural areas of the province – and even in larger and more diverse cities.“I think [voters] should assess whether an extra few hundred dollars in your pocket is really worth sacrificing what you truly believe is right,” said Mielke. “This is a choice between a progressive plan to support our oil industry and diversify our economy … or a return to the sort of ‘old boys’ school of politics that’s really ruled Alberta for the last 30 years.”But for others, the choice is less clear – and less satisfying.“There’s things from every party that everybody wants – and that’s the pickle. Nobody aligns perfectly with any party,” said Cheryl. She admitted that the socially conservative elements of Kenney’s party are a “concern” within her social circle, but concluded: “You have to choose your battles and what’s most important to you or your family that day.”"},

Unless you are George Baker.The award-winning actor from eastern India is one of just two members of the country’s 545-seat lower house whose name will not appear on any ballot in India’s six-week election season, which .A vestige of India’s colonial history, and a sign of the magnanimous spirit with which the country said goodbye to its British former masters, his is one of two seats in the country’s parliament still reserved for Anglo-Indians: Indian citizens of European descent.“It’s more or less an accepted part of the constitution,” says Baker, whose parents were Greek and migrated to  via Britain shortly before he was born in 1946.Along with another Anglo-Indian, Richard Hay, Baker was appointed to parliament in 2015, where he has the same powers as any MP to vote and spend money on the development of the estimated 150,000 members of his community who remain. Their terms last until 2020.Anglo-Indians are distinct from Indian Christians, who have existed in the country since shortly after Jesus’s reputed death. Nor were they British citizens, who were free to return home after India became independent in 1947.The community who have been called “Midnight’s Orphans” were caught in the middle: descendants of Europeans who had married Indians or else migrated and settled in the country; Christians who spoke English and cultivated British lifestyles but with Indian lineages stretching back hundreds of years, in some cases.Baker, who is best known for his role as a British planter who falls in love with an Indian worker in the 1975 film Chameli Memsaab, speaks four local languages and has married a Hindu woman.“Those Anglo-Indians who have married others in the community try to follow the rule [of living a life that is] 60% British and 40% Indian,” he says from his government apartment in Delhi, within view of the colossal Roman dome of the former Indian viceroy’s residence. “In my case it’s closer to 50/50.”India’s independence was a troubling development for many Anglo-Indians. Their fortunes had ebbed and flowed under colonial rule: first rewarded under the East India Company, then spurned when it was feared they might dominate the colony, as mixed-heritage people had done in parts of South America.After the Indian rebellion , British colonisers again pulled the Anglo-Indians close, relying on them in disproportionate numbers to run the railway, postal and telegraph networks.An idea to create a separate homeland for Anglo-Indians in the hills of the eastern state of Bihar was dismissed, according to the historian William Dalrymple.Freedom for the subcontinent meant hard choices. “The community could no longer stand on two stools,” wrote Frank Anthony, an Anglo-Indian leader who occupied one of the reserved parliamentary seats for decades.In speeches before independence, Anthony urged his people to throw in their lot with India. “Let us cling and cling, tenaciously, to all that we hold dear, our language, our way of life and our distinctive culture,” he said. “But let us always remember that we are Indians ... The more we love and are loyal to India, the more will India love and be loyal to us.”Anthony failed to convince the British to carve out a special place for Anglo-Indians in the colony’s post-independence government – his book about the community’s struggles would be titled Britain’s Betrayal in India.But India’s first leaders were bighearted. Recognising the community was too diffuse ever to be elected to a parliamentary seat, they reserved two places for them. “They were once part-rulers of this country,” , “and therefore they should be shown some partiality for some time to come.”Yet many still felt out of place. “In the old day there was a mindset that we were between the Britishers and the Indians,” says Bridget White-Kumar, an Anglo-Indian living in the city of Bengaluru. “Sometimes we were not treated well.”“Indians used to have a suspicion of us,” says Baker. “They would think of us as the people who used to carry tales to the Britishers that got them into trouble.“But now so many Dravidians from south India have married Aryans of north India,” he says, in a reference to two of India’s cultural groups. “India is a pleasant potpourri of humanity.”White-Kumar grew up in an Indian mining town that was a “little England”, she says. “Everyone spoke perfect English, we studied in English schools, we ate Kraft cheese and Coleman’s mustard and corn flakes.” In 1956, the Indian government reclaimed the mine from its British owners, marking the end of an era. Like hundreds of thousands of Anglo-Indians, many of the surrounding town’s residents emigrated to the UK, Canada or Australia, where they mostly thrived. The community counts among its ranks the singer Engelbert Humperdinck and the actor Sir Ben Kingsley.Those that remained behind, such as White-Kumar, have gradually become part of the Indian melting pot. “I was born here and I’m a citizen, so I’m Indian,” she says.A hint of defensiveness persists, however. “Contrary to all that has been said to denigrate their origins, the Anglo-India community developed along quite formal and legitimate lines,” says the All India Anglo Indian Association of Delhi, in  of its history of the community.The Anglo-Indian reservation in parliament was supposed to have been phased out by 1960. But successive governments have kept renewing it, even as the Anglo-Indian population is thought to have dwindled (though nobody by how much, as they are not counted separately in the Indian census).One explanation for why it keeps getting renewed is that Anglo-Indians require more help than ever to have their voice heard in parliament. Another, more pragmatic one is that political parties still want the opportunity to install friendly members into parliament, without the hassle of having to get them elected.Baker says he plans to ask the prime minister to renew the reservations again when they expire in 2020. “Gradually we are being integrated, but total assimilation will take a minimum of another 50 years,” he says.In the meantime, their traditions are being kept alive by people such as White-Kumar, who publishes cookbooks of Anglo-Indian cuisine: recipes such as mulligatawny soup, which blend Indian ingredients with British tastes. “We are a bit more judicious in our use of spices,” she explains."},

The business grew in popularity with the city’s music singers and concertgoers, and began attracting white customers, eventually establishing hot chicken as a near-ubiquitous .The craze for hot chicken has also spread to cities in the US including , New York and , and internationally as far away as Seoul and Melbourne. And it’s soon coming to .A few years ago, KFC in the US  on the bandwagon and now has “” on its menu.But although some , Nashville is home to the speciality and Jeffries is the keeper of the recipe for the most authentic version. Last year Prince’s was lauded as an icon in Eater’s annual list.The line inside the Ewing location of Prince’s Hot Chicken Shack. In December 2018 an SUV collided into the strip mall where Prince’s was located, causing serious damage to the business. Photograph: Joe BuglewiczWhen I visit the south outpost of  Hot Chicken, the line is 50 people deep and the restaurant steams with spices as Jeffries waves to the regulars. The original location – north of the city centre – remains under construction after an early morning car crash and subsequent fire led to its temporary closure.Every evening, until the closure, Jeffries would take her place at the original location, from 5pm until midnight.“My little hole in the wall, I miss it,” she says in frustration. A delayed reopening has kept her from perching over her chicken kingdom, her second home. She leans in conspiratorially to tell me that she has heard even members of the British royal family enjoy the chicken.The first Prince’s Hot Chicken opened almost 80 years ago. Photograph: Ben Rollins/The GuardianJeffries loves telling the story of how it all began – thanks to her cheating uncle’s angry girlfriend.Great Uncle Thornton, who Jeffries says was tall, charming and good looking, stayed out late one night and came home just in time for the Sunday morning meal. To punish him, his furious girlfriend had thrown so much pepper into the chicken it wouldn’t be edible: of that she was sure. When she served it up to her philandering partner, he took one bite, loved it and asked her to make it again, going on to adapt it for his chicken shack. The rest is history.“Everyone gives him credit for opening it, but I give it to the lady he was with,” Jeffries says with a smirk. “It certainly got his attention – and it’s still getting people’s attention.”Jeffries took over in the 1980s. “Here I am stepping up, not knowing anything,” she says with a laugh, “I had only cooked chicken once growing up.”She changed two things: the original shack had been dubbed a BBQ chicken joint. “It was hot, spicy, so I wanted to name it after the family name and the hot chicken. So off we went.”The quarter plate of hot chicken served with french fries. Photograph: Joe BuglewiczThe other change is what has made the shack famous.The original hot chicken is now the mild option. Jeffries added variations, ranging from plain to XXX hot, though at one point she refused to keep the XXX version on the menu anymore. “It’s extra hot. I don’t like to keep it here. Somebody in the kitchen might see somebody they don’t like and give it to them. That has happened. I don’t want somebody to use it as a lethal weapon,” she said with a wink.She sticks to the mild version herself, though she loves patrons trying the flaming red-tinged hot version of the chicken with a slice of pickle.“One woman told me she has a special car seat for the chicken. She has a safety belt for the chicken. Can you imagine?”Her uncle’s original shack was popular with the black community in the city, and later attracted white diners.  notes how: “Under Jim Crow, the Princes were not free to dine wherever and however they wanted, or to use the front door of white establishments, but they never told their own customers where to sit or what door to use. The matter handled itself: black patrons sat up front; whites entered through the back door and sat in back.”One patron proclaims Prince’s “the place to be” and explains how much his family love its diversity. Bob Armstrong, 53, talks as he has a meal with his 15-year-old daughter Clea. The family moved to Nashville three years ago from Singapore. “You’ve got black, white, everything in the the vibe. It’s diverse,” Armstrong says.Rosalind Turner, 54, is a Nashville native who has been coming to get her fix for 35 years. “There’s no taste like it. It can’t get duplicated because this is where hot chicken started,” she claimed. When she was younger, she says, she used to go weekly to the original location. This visit, she sat in traffic for an hour, just to get her portion of mild chicken.Margaret Lehner, 11, says her dad has brought her here for the second time. She’s managed to get as far as the mild version but her dad eats the hot version, she says. “I like it ‘cause it’s fast and because it tastes better than a lot of places.”“I love everything about it,” declares Bryan Fay, 30. “I think she [Jeffries] does it best.” Though he now orders the medium version, the first time he came in 2009 he ordered the hot version and had to run to the bathroom to put his face under the faucet.Mariah Bailey, 14, has been eating at Prince’s since she was three. Her mom cooks at the original location and her brother is also a cook, so this famous chicken is what she has grown up on. The teen says she only eats it extra hot. “I like the flavor. It has always been in my family.”Twins Tommy and Tony Legg, 48, both ask for their chicken mild. They became regulars recently after hearing about the famous chicken from their aunt. “It’s good! I love the service, I love the food, especially the fries,” Tommy said.Jeffries waves to Casy Goines, 22, who is carrying her daughter, Kylie. The mother of two will only eat her chicken extra hot and has been ordering it like that since she was 12. “I like the pain”, she says with a smile. Goines says she comes in nearly every single day, a habit she picked up from her mother. Even her three-year-old eats the mild chicken."},

At about 2am, a lightning bolt hit the cathedral’s south transept and started a fire that raged through the building, collapsing the roof and causing millions of pounds’ worth of damage.“I remember some people coming to the building in tears,” he said. “I didn’t have that emotion. I was just thinking ‘let’s get it all cleared out and get it rebuilt’. There was no doubt in my mind that we could repair it, sympathetically, and in the same spirit that it was built.”On Monday night, David watched in horror . But he remains optimistic that the building can be brought back to its former glory. “The roof’s completely gone and there is damage to the vaulting, which does concern me, but the rest of it is repairable,” he said. “There are people who can do it.”According to Prof Stefan Holzer, from the building archaeology and construction history group at the ETH Zürich university, the first priority needs to be the installation of a temporary roof to prevent further damage from “atmospheric influences” such as rain.He said scaffolding should be erected inside the building to check that the structure was secure. It is possible that water used to extinguish the fire has caused damage to plaster, masonry and furnishings, while the high temperatures during the fire may have made the stone work less solid.Of particular worry at  were the rose windows, three immense round stained-glass windows that date back to the 13th century. On Tuesday afternoon, they were reported as saved.Sarah Brown, the director of York Glaziers Trust, which preserves and restores the stained glass at York Minster, said she had emailed her French counterparts to offer help and support.“Stained glass, of course, is made in heat,” she said. “The glass is manufactured in heat and the painted decoration is fused to the glass’s surface in a kiln so it can be surprisingly robust and resistant to fire.”In the case of the York Minster fire, the solder that holds the pieces of glass together melted, leaving the structure unsafe. The glass also suffered from thermal shock, in part because cold water had been sprayed on it by firefighters, said Brown. “This causes rapid cooling, so the combination of fire and the cooling effect of the water causes lots of little micro-cracks to form on the glass.”On 20 November 1992,  – one of the official residences of the Queen. The blaze began in the Queen’s private chapel at 11.15am when a curtain was set alight by a spotlight pressed against it.It caused extensive damage to about an eighth of the castle, including the collapse of a number of ceilings. The restoration project cost £36.5m and was finally finished in 1997.Francis Maude, the director at Donald Insall Associates which managed the Windsor Castle restoration, said the speed of the Notre Dame project would depend not on the availability of materials, but on the availability of skilled craftspeople.He said it was too soon to estimate the cost, but pointed to plans for , which is estimated to be at least £3.5bn. Notre Dame was smaller, he said, but more thoroughly damaged.He said his work on the Windsor project had provoked a debate about the use of fire resistant materials in any reconstruction – some parts were rebuilt using wooden beams and others using steel. “I think there’s a discussion to be had about whether the roof should be rebuilt to entirely replicate the original,” he said.“There may be other voices out there who say that they can recreate the form of the roof using materials that people use today – in other words a steel structure that can’t catch light. Though with an effective fire suppression system, you can build in oak and have a thatched roof, like .”David said he hoped that Notre Dame would be restored in the “traditional manner with traditional materials” and that “there was nothing wrong with the materials that the building has been built with”.“You can add fire precaution measures and things like this, but the expertise is there,” he said. “Buildings represent so much. They represent a history of a certain period of civilisation. And York Minster, like Notre Dame in , represents the city.”"},

It has a 15 FOOT long Body and a 21” SKULL with Serrated Teeth! This Rex was very a very dangerous meat eater. It’s a RARE opportunity indeed to ever see a baby REX…”The skeleton, estimated to be 68m years old, was first discovered in 2013, on private land in Montana. It became the property of the man who discovered it, Alan Detrich, a professional fossil hunter. In 2017, Detrich lent the fossil to the University of Kansas Natural History Museum, where it was still on display when Detrich made the surprise decision to put it up for auction.Analysis of the skeleton may help to settle a  over whether small Tyrannosaurs from North America are infants or should have the separate classification of Nanotyrannus. Such research may now be impossible with the fossil likely to end up in a private collection.The Society of Vertebrate Palaeontology (SVP) has criticised both Detrich, who will be taking an important specimen , and the university, for helping to inflate the price of the fossil, acting as a shop window for professional buyers.In an open letter published last week, SVP’s members said that it was regrettable that the fossil was exhibited before it could be studied. “That action, which brought the fossil to the attention of hundreds or thousands of visitors, potentially enhanced its commercial value,” they wrote. “Museums seldom have the budget for purchase of increasingly expensive privately collected specimens.”The University of Kansas has subsequently said they were unaware of Detrich’s plans to put the skeleton up for auction. the museum’s director, Leonard Krishtalka, said the exhibit has now been removed and returned to Detrich, and they have asked for any association with the museum to be removed from the listing.So far no one has expressed interest in paying the asking price, although there is the option to make an offer, and the item has more than 100 people “watching” it. Any museums hoping they might be able to shell out for a quick study and then send it back will be disappointed – Detrich has specified a no returns policy."},

Overnight, the tiny , , had tumbled into the bath, a pitfall trap whose vertical sides were too smooth for it to escape.It’s a while since I’ve encountered one of these ancient wingless insects, a survivor from the Devonian period that now lives among humans in the Anthropocene and still resembles its 400m-year-old fossil ancestors.Silverfish thrive in cool, humid conditions, so modern centrally heated houses are a hostile environment, but they were a familiar sight during my 1950s childhood, in damp, dark corners of my grandmother’s house, heated with its single coal fire. They feed on carbohydrates, like spilled sugar and flour, so her larder (she had no refrigerator for food storage) was a good place to look for them. Lepisma is a fast mover, so catching one, as it zigzagged between cans and bottles, was challenging but the technique I learned as a child – coaxing it on to a sheet of paper and sliding it into a glass jar – served me well today.In 1665, Robert Hooke, pioneer observer of the living world under a magnifying glass, waxed lyrical about these “small silver-colour’d book-worms”, describing how a “multitude of their reflecting scales, which from the multiplicity of their reflecting surfaces, make the whole animal appear of a perfect pearly-colour”. , published in his , is an astonishingly accurate depiction of a creature that rarely stands still, pursued by a scientist with an insatiable spirit of inquiry.Anyone finding one of these little carrot-shaped insects, which roam while the household sleeps, might be tempted to just squash it, but they should follow Hooke’s example and take a close look. Under a hand lens I could see the shimmering, pearlescent scales that he so admired: what a wonderful fabric design they might make for a slinky dress to be worn on a Hollywood red carpet.For silverfish, this coating of iridescent scales that slough off at the slightest touch is functional rather than decorative; there are spiders in our bathroom too, and that easily shed armour probably helps them to escape a predator’s jaws."},
{"title": "'We wanted a new vibe': the Japanese town that outlawed sprawl", "time": "Wed 17 Apr 2019 ", "category": "Cities", "tags": "Cities,Resilient cities,Japan disaster,Japan,Tsunamis,Asia Pacific,Natural disasters and extreme weather,Earthquakes,features", "content": "n the shore of eastern Japan a wrecked police station lies on its side, ripped from the ground by  that devastated the country in 2011.“We are going to keep that building as a reminder of the disaster,” says Yoshinori Taura, assistant director of the town of Onagawa’s recovery promotion division. “To make sure the memories are passed to the next generation.”This is about more than sentiment. Onagawa was obliterated by the tsunami; as it builds a new future, the ruined police station will be a daily reminder to run to high ground whenever the tsunami siren sounds.But the reconstruction is about more than keeping the town safe from natural disasters. The municipality is also trying to find a way to build a thriving, bustling community despite massive population decline. The tsunami only accelerated Onagawa’s precipitous shrinking, which is now the fastest of any of the country’s municipalities: between 1965 and 2011, the population halved, to 10,000. It has now dropped to around 6,500.How could the town not merely rebuild after the worst disaster in  since the atomic bombings, but somehow also stay active and bustling?The solution Onagawa lit upon is bold: a near-total ban on any non-residential facilities in any of the housing settlements. In effect, Onagawa is forcing people to come into the town centre to do anything – to work, shop, go to school or use public services. Onagawa has outlawed sprawl.By having these facilities in the centre of town we hope that we will be able to attract a new energy and a new vibeThe aim is to build what the municipality calls a “bustling centre” in the commercial district in front of the new railway station. The idea is that even if the population declines, the town centre will still be buzzing.“This town planning takes into account the population decrease,” says Taura. “By having these facilities in the centre of town we hope that we will be able to attract a new energy and a new vibe.”The tsunami triggered by the Great East Japan Earthquake – the largest in Japanese history – . More than 560 sq km of land was flooded, 22,000 people died and hundreds of thousands were evacuated. Onagawa, in Miyagi prefecture, was hit harder than any other municipality: the water, funnelled towards the shore by the surrounding bay, was 14 metres high when it enveloped the town, killing 827 people and destroying two-thirds of the buildings.Japan is dedicating vast resources, funded by higher income tax, to recovering from the earthquake, the tsunami and the accompanying . Over 10 years, Onagawa will have received 243bn yen (£1.7bn) in state support.The citizens, struggling with bereavement, loss and dislocation in the aftermath of the tsunami, could have been forgiven for leaving decisions about how to rebuild to officials. They did the opposite: hundreds of residents attended what were sometimes intense public meetings to discuss the future.The mayor, Yoshiaki Suda, says: “Despite having lost communities and families, each person has to come face-to-face with their situation, and I think that may be why they had so much interest in how the town would be rebuilt.”The key controversy was whether to rebuild the 14 surrounding villages, or to cluster new homes in the original town centre. The mayor at the time, Nobutaka Azumi, favoured consolidation, but he was opposed by older residents and  by Suda. Now the villages will be rebuilt – but the services will be concentrated in one spot, forcing everyone to come to Onagawa to use them.There were other goals. With the town’s success dependent on attracting and keeping young people, the perception among local firms that the older generation of business leaders was driving the recovery was a problem. “The leaders of the business community said to everyone over 60: ‘Don’t get too much involved,’” says Hideki Doi, who leads public-private partnerships for the town.Keen to avoid turning Onagawa into a fort, the rebuilding programme involves  to manage the risks of a future tsunami. The area around the waterfront is restricted to a park – the fallen police station will be the centrepiece of a memorial – and to buildings essential to the fishing industry. Behind that, protected by a road built high enough to act as a barrier to a relatively low “level 1” tsunami (about four metres high in Onagawa), is the commercial district centred .We hope that the way we rebuild the town will serve as a model to deal with how to bring people back to the community and stay in the communityThe new residential areas are now cut into the mountainsides, just high enough to be safe from a level 2 tsunami, around 17 metres high in Onagawa.“Our town is surrounded by the ocean, mountains and forest, so there is very little flat land, so we are cutting into the mountains and creating it,” says Taura.“The residential areas will be high enough to be safe from a large tsunami. The lower area will only be for commercial and the station. We have made sure that housing cannot be built on this area.”All around the bay, a massive construction operation is shoring up the hillsides with concrete reinforcements, cutting and levelling the land and laying roads connecting the new communities with the town. Millions of tonnes of earth have been moved. Development is almost complete. Most survivors have been rehoused, with about 40 families still in temporary accommodation.But it remains to be seen if the anti-sprawl effort will succeed in focusing energy on the now-smaller town. Like the UK, Japan is struggling with shuttered high streets as businesses close. Before the tsunami, much of Onagawa town centre was in private hands, so the municipality had limited ability to address the problem. But now it has taken ownership of the land, and a community development company owns the shops and manages the tenants. Supported by grants, around 40 shops are already occupied. They give the town a bohemian air: there is a guitar manufacturer, a soap company, a tile factory, coffee shops, artisan food outlets and various festivals.The way forward is far from clear, however. A third of businesses that existed before the tsunami have not survived. Despite investment, determination, optimism and creativity, there is still fear that population decline could prove too powerful a foe.“How to make this town successful for the future is still the question we struggle with,” says the mayor. “We hope that the way we rebuild the town will serve as a model to deal with how to bring people back to the community and stay in the community. Of course it is important to build infrastructure, but what is most important is that the citizens have an energy and excitement to come together to build the town.”"},

On Monday Ghassan Salamé, the UN’s special envoy for Libya, accused Haftar of mounting a coup attempt.As the fighters controlling Tajoura prepare for a showdown, some of the hundreds of refugees and migrants inside the complex, and in other detention centres across Tripoli, are worried that they will become victims and targets, after they were forced to take an active role supporting militias aligned with the GNA. Compelling detained refugees and migrants to support fighters could constitute a war crime.Since Haftar’s advance began on 4 April, migrants and refugees in three detention centres have told the Guardian they were taken out of locked halls and ordered to carry and move weapons, with some transferred to military bases around the city. In a fourth centre, detainees said people had been taken away by fighters, but they don’t know what’s happened to them.“The police and soldiers force migrants to do cleaning work and load weapons. They [tell] migrants that if you know how to shoot a gun we will make you stay with us,” said one migrant who messaged the Guardian using a hidden phone.The Guardian has also been sent photos of migrants wearing what appear to be military uniforms.“We even washed the cars that were full with the blood of the soldiers who were killed on the war front,” said another detainee. “They put the dead bodies in the military cars. I’m not feeling good but I don’t have a choice here.”“Forcing civilians to stockpile weapons in a warzone counts as abusive forced labour, is unlawfully cruel, and puts them at unnecessary risk,” said Judith Sunderland, associate director for the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. “Making them wear uniforms suggests they are being used as hostages or human shields, both of which are war crimes.”“Far from pressing detained migrants into these dangerous activities, all parties should be taking all possible measures to avoid civilian casualties. The authorities should release all migrants who are arbitrarily detained and ensure their safety.”About 6,000 refugees and migrants are currently locked up in detention centres ostensibly under the control of Libya’s directorate for combating illegal migration, which is associated with the government of Fayez al-Sarraj.In reality, however, many of the centres are run by militias. The directorate did not respond to multiple requests for comment.The roughly 600 detainees in Tajoura are among tens of thousands of men, women, and children who have been intercepted in the Mediterranean sea trying to reach Europe over the past two years, and brought back to indefinite detention. The EU is spending tens of millions of euros to train, fund, and equip the Libyan coastguard, in a .“They know what is going on in the Libyan detention centres but the EU pretend like they don’t know,” said one detainee. “Libya is not the right place or safe place for refugees and migrants to stay. They should stop bringing back those who tried to cross the sea.”A detainee in another Tripoli centre said: “Libya is a market of human beings. People are still working by slaving in Libya, so how can people stay in ?”Before the escalation of fighting over the past 11 days, more than a dozen current and former detainees spoke to the Guardian about their experiences of forced labour. Sometimes they worked for Libyan guards in the detention centres, and sometimes for people associated with them, including relatives. and migrants said they have cleaned houses, constructed buildings and toiled on farms.“As a detainee it is a great opportunity [to] escape the stuffy prison, or at least you got to see the sun and also fresh air while working enslaved,” said an Eritrean who was caught at sea in May 2018, and escaped to Tunisia at the end of last year.Women didn’t have to leave the centres to work but some minors did, he said. “Even underage [people] go to that enslaving labour.”Detainees had been forced to work for four or five months straight, another man claimed, saying he had built houses for guards working for the directorate for combating illegal migration. “If I stop working or take a rest they will start shouting in a threatening way that scares me … If migrants try to escape, they’re going to shoot them.”Sometimes workers are rewarded with cigarettes, bread or vegetables, but sometimes they get nothing, he said.The prevalence of forced labour in Libyan migrant detention centres has been confirmed by other sources, including Human Rights Watch and the UN.A , released in December, said investigators had documented testimonies of forced labour in six detention centres between 2017 and 2018, including Tajoura and Triq al Sikka, which lies further north in Tripoli.In October last year, a 28-year-old Somali man set himself alight in Triq al Sikka after dousing himself with petrol from a generator he accessed while working, according to witnesses. Abdulaziz felt hopeless about his chances of evacuation, friends said. The International Organization for  and the UN refugee agency confirmed the death.A few months ago, another refugee described being made to work in a weapons store. “One day I have gone to work there. They have different weapons such as tanks with their rockets, and different bombs.”"},

We don’t pick and choose.”Asked if he would be comfortable taking the field again alongside Folau, Wallabies and NSW Waratahs captain flanker Hooper said: “In this current state and being here and talking about this as a rugby player, it makes it hard, it makes it difficult.“You take your friends warts and all, and your teammates,” Hooper added.Cheika said he didn’t think the issue would rear its head again after the controversy of last year’s tweets and Rugby Australia’s subsequent talks with Folau.He had tried unsuccessfully to contact him for an explanation.“We had a discussion at the end of the last time and made it pretty clear about his right to believe and our support in that if that’s what he wants,” he said.“I felt that I needed to talk to him about why, and I haven’t had that chance as yet. I’m sure I will in the future at some stage when it settles down for him a little bit.“I made the calls and left the messages. There’s no beef.”Folau told reporters after attending his church on Sunday that he stood by his posts and .Waratahs CEO Andrew Hore said that his players, one of whom is Folau’s brother John, had been briefed on Monday."},

The amendments would also increase the control of the military, which would be given powers to police the political sphere in Egypt. They would also give Sisi control over the appointment of judges and the public prosecutor.These amendments are to be voted on by the people in a referendum, but there is no one who believes that this would be anything close to free or fair. Sisi is desperate to overstay his welcome in power and it is for this reason that we have decided to run a “shadow” referendum, to show the true will of the Egyptian people.In typical Sisi fashion, the  in Egypt after reaching 60,000 signatures in the first few hours of its launch.

There are now more than 250,000 signatures. The apparent full force of the Egyptian government is not able to fully silence the true will of the people.In fact, only a few weeks earlier another wave of discontent flooded Egyptian social media through the “You are not Alone” hashtag. It was started by Motaaz Matar, an Egyptian opposition journalist working from a TV station based in Turkey. He called on people to tweet with the hashtag (Be assured, you are not alone), and within a few hours it spilled over the border and became the top trending hashtag in Egypt, Algeria, Qatar and Jordan.Everyone from opposition leaders to journalists, foreign politicians and just regular people joined in, prompting the Sisi regime to respond with extreme violence and targeting those participating in the campaign.All the people who oppose [Egypt] from TV stations based abroad, I swear they will be punished.The parliament issued a new amendment to the already-draconian anti-terror law, , or inciting action against the state would be increased from five years to 10 years imprisonment.But Sisi’s online war began long before the void and You Are Not Alone campaigns.Indeed, before the revolution in 2010, when he was a director of military intelligence,  that “social media will have a critical impact on Egypt and our region”.He made sure to act swiftly on this.

{"title": "No longer simply the country music capital of the world, the city is expanding rapidly – but its unique culture is feeling the strain", "time": "Tue 16 Apr 2019 ", "category": "Cities", "tags": "Nashville,Amazon,features", "content": "If you are looking for signs of Nashville’s entrepreneurial spirit, ask Robbie Goldsmith why he decided to quit his job.“I used to live downtown and we’d go out on Broadway because it was fun and we naturally saw more and more of these bachelorette parties and they would come up to [me] and ask what [they] should do.” What Goldsmith did was quit his corporate job to start his company, Bach Weekend, he explains as he walks down Broadway, which despite the early afternoon hour is already giving out a party vibe with the waft of spilled beer and burgers drifting across the wide sidewalks.Sidewalks, Goldsmith says, that had to be expanded when tourism numbers skyrocketed in recent years.Approximately 14 million people visit the city each year, the Chamber of Commerce estimates. This year, around 100,000 are due to show up in late April alone for the National Football League (NFL) draft. In explaining its choice of city, the NFL published  citing Nashville’s music, barbeque, and Broadway as factors making it the perfect location for 2019.Nashville, unequivocally, is an economic success story, and not just in recent years, when outlets like the New York Times dubbed it the .The mid-size southern city has been firmly financially rooted in a sprawling healthcare services industry and Christian book publishing since the 1980s, and has been growing for some time. With a burgeoning tourism industry laid on the foundation of its entertainment bedrock, the success of its economic development is clear amid the gentrifying neighborhoods and throngs of visitors passing shoulder-to-shoulder as they peruse the live music options while vying for bar seats.“We just hit the perfect time of Nashville becoming a booming city,” Goldsmith yells over live music at the George Jones. Part of his success, he guesses, is because about 87% of the country is within driving distance of .As Goldsmith strolls the main drag here, he points out that none of the bars downtown – from the purple-painted staple Tootsie’s, to the two-storey George Jones, to the expansive Jason Aldean Rooftop bar – charge a cover fee. They don’t need to: he estimates the average bachelorette and each of her friends or family members spends around $1,000 while in Nashville. And given that Goldsmith estimates around 150,000 visitors dance, drink, and selfie their way through Nashville each year, this equates to about $12m in revenue. Goldsmith’s services have become so popular that Country Music Television gave him a reality show for a season as his company escorted partygoers around the city.But Tennessee’s capital is attracting more than just raucous weekend visitors. Nashville, once primarily known as the capital of country music, is now also one of America’s fastest-growing cities, and its economy is often cited as a successful model.Around 94 people moved here on a daily basis in 2017, according to a  from the Nashville Chamber of Commerce, and the city has added nearly 400,000 new residents in the past decade.Attracting them are 40,000 businesses, and growing, in the metropolitan area. These will soon to include  when it opens a new operations centre downtown, promising 5,000 well-paid new jobs.Such growth inevitably creates issues, said Anne Barnett, the co-chair of Stand Up Nashville, a community labour organisation representing the rights of working people in the city. As it battles the impacts of gentrification, transport pressures and , Nashville is trying to maintain its unique sense of identity and accessibility.“One of the things that makes Nashville  is its rich culture of art and food, and most of that doesn’t come from the most wealthy,” Barnett said. “It comes from the folks that are middle-class and below middle-class.“As people are getting pushed out of the city, these really cherished institutions – even restaurants and music venues – are being torn down to build these mix use developments. Whole neighbourhoods are being basically wiped out and rebuilt.“The longer that is allowed to go on, Nashville is going to lose its culture, which is why people want to move to Nashville in the first place.”Barnett recently visited Amazon’s hometown, Seattle, where she says she saw an extreme housing and homeless crisis. With those issues already plaguing Nashville, she worries about how much worse it might get when Jeff Bezos’s tech behemoth arrives in the city.Nashville’s city council this month approved a $17.5m incentive package for Amazon, despite concerns around  and the wider anxieties around Big Tech coming to town that  Amazon’s New York City plans. Barnett wonders how many of those jobs will go to city residents versus city transplants and, if the majority of hires fall in the latter category, what it will do to exacerbate Nashville’s economic inequality.The mayor’s office, according to the Tennessean newspaper, insists the approved package is a “sound investment”. The city unemployment rate is just 2.7% and it shared the top spot for job growth in the US with Orlando, Florida, the Wall Street Journal recently .The city’s mayor, David Briley, said: “I would describe our city as a place that still has a lot of our southern hospitality, hopefully, in the good sense of what that used to mean. We have become very diverse economically [and] racially.”On Amazon, speaking before the city approval of the incentive, Briley said: “One, it’s a good place for them to build, and two, 5,000 jobs was something we could incorporate into our growth and development without being overwhelmed by it.”The Amazon investment will equate to $750m a year, the mayor estimates, based on 5,000 jobs with a median salary of $150,000. He says the city will also invest $2.5m a year.But Barnett says: “There were a lot of cranes in the sky [in Seattle] and it really reminded me of some of the same things we’re seeing here in Nashville – a lot of new luxury apartments, a lot of new office buildings and hotels. I fear we’re going to become a city for wealthy people and not a city that lifts up everyone.”Nashville has been growing since the 1980s. Its sprawling healthcare sector employs more than a quarter of a million locals , a significant number in a city of 700,000 people.It is also the Bible-printing hub of the US. LifeWay Christian Resources, for example, the Southern Baptist Convention’s publishing arm, has over 1,100 employees in Nashville, and has been a part of the city since 1891. HarperCollins’ Christian publishing division is also in the city, selling over 60 million Bibles in the past five years.The city’s music industry, meanwhile, generates an annual $10bn economic impact on the city – through jobs, tourism and by attracting the film industry, according to a 2013 report. Marcus Cobb, 41, moved here from Chicago four years ago to expand his music tech company  with the aid of Nashville’s . Initially he was reluctant to move but when he did, he said, it changed his life.“It’s one of the few cities where the entire range of businesses is within a radius of two or two-and-a-half miles,” Cobb said, sitting in one of the center’s conference rooms. “Everything from publishing hymnals to producing records and labels – everything – is in this one playground. This turned out to be an accelerator for us.”Now, Cobb’s startup is utilised by 400 enterprises, with more than 15,000 users across five countries. “I think this is the only city where we could have done that with the budget we had,” he said, “in large part because of the community we’re a part of.”A proportion of Nashville’s economic rising star can be attributed to the grassroots investment the city has made into its new and existing residents with incentives like the nonprofit Entrepreneur Center, which took shape in 2010. Currently, the center is working with 250 entrepreneurs and has over 500 alumni.“Our vision is [for Nashville] to be the best place to start a business by 2025, that’s our goal,” says the centre’s vice-president of community investment, Anne Elizabeth McIntosh.Nashville’s shiny image has, though, been showing one of the usual cracks of success: inequality. Ryan Culwell, a musician, moved here with his wife in 2010, for career reasons. He ended up getting a record deal, publicity in Rolling Stone and has had his music featured on shows like Hart of Dixie and Netflix’s The Ranch, but still needs to work second jobs, like driving for car shares, to pay the rent.A longtime resident of a traditionally diverse and working-class neighbourhood in south Nashville, Culwell also homeschools his children because he believes the education supplied by local public schools is not good enough. Even in this working-class neighbourhood, his family of six is being quickly priced out of their 950 sq ft home. “Our rent has gone up 50% in the last five years,” he said. “It could have easily doubled but our landlord has kept it down because he [sees] us as a small family.”According to a 2017 Brookings , “In Nashville, 40% of all jobs (and 26 of the top 50 occupations) do not pay enough for workers to afford fair-market rent for a one-bedroom apartment.”The city’s own data shows the average cost of a home has increased by $75,000 in the last decade. The mayor admits this is an issue, saying: “We are certainly seeing gentrification in our historically black neighbourhoods in particular. Although we have it in traditionally white neighbourhoods, too.”The gentrification trend is obvious in the neighbourhood between Music Row and downtown, The Gulch, an area full of restaurants and boutique hotels. Just a few years ago, it was a railroad corridor. Here, bachelorettes in matching shirts and tiaras form a line, eager to take Instagram-ready photos in front of a wall painted with wings.  is a Ghanaian-American vocalist and songwriter who has lived in the city on and off since she was three, but has always made her way back. “The opportunity [in Nashville] is the reason my family came and the reason I’m still here,” she says over breakfast at the Marsh House restaurant inside the Thompson hotel, a Gulch staple. Because she was in Nashville, she attended schools where the focus was on arts, where they had a state-of-the-art studio and she was able to record as a teenager, she says.In recent years, she has worked with  and Jack White, and sang on Beyoncé’s Lemonade album. That wouldn’t have been possible anywhere else, Amanfu says. “Everywhere I go, people say, ‘Oh, you’re from Nashville. Country music.’“So we’ve had to create this community … The country community will always be embraced but now the diversity is being embraced in music. And it reaches so much farther than this city.”Mayor Briley agrees with Amanfu, but adds that the city aiming for diversity not simply in its music and industries, but also in the community as a whole. Briley considers Atlanta and Los Angeles to be the most reasonable role models for the city’s ambition. “We’re more likely to be like LA than Atlanta,” he says, though that might be more wishful thinking than reality. He points to Nashville’s diversifying population with the influx of immigrants and the multitude of jobs. Still, he acknowledges the myriad issues that come with success – like the soaring wealth and extreme poverty plaguing . He would also like to stay away from the stigma associated with Atlanta’s  that seem to have pushed longtime residents out of the expanding city.Barnett, though, says the city shouldn’t try to be like any city except itself. “Nashville is going to lose its culture. It’s not just individuals being moved out, it’s the heart of the city.”"},

The figures are edging closer to those of the 2017 outbreak, when 1 million cases were reported.The prospect of a major new cholera epidemic, exacerbated by both the advent of rains and the difficulties for humanitarian workers in reaching conflict affected areas, comes with no end to the violence in sight.The warnings coincide with the decision by President Donald Trump on Tuesday to  passed by Congress to end US military assistance in Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen – seen as a significant political message.“This resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities, endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future,” Trump wrote in explaining his veto.The US provides billions of dollars of arms to the Saudi-led coalition fighting against Iran-backed rebels in Yemen with members of Congress expressing concern about the thousands of civilians killed in coalition airstrikes since the conflict began in 2014.The fighting in the Arab world’s poorest country has also left millions suffering from food and medical care shortages and has pushed the country to the .David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee, a humanitarian aid group, said: “This veto by President Trump is morally wrong and strategically wrongheaded. It sets back the hopes for respite for the Yemeni people, and leaves the US upholding a failed strategy.”"},

The consultation will last until the end of May, and the final version of the code of practice, touted as a new international standard, is expected to come into effect by 2020.Elizabeth Denham, the information commissioner, said: “This is the connected generation. The internet and all its wonders are hardwired into their everyday lives.“We shouldn’t have to prevent our children from being able to use it, but we must demand that they are protected when they do. This code does that.”The ICO sought views from parents and children while developing the code of practice, as well as those of designers, app developers and academics.The NSPCC children’s charity said social networks had “continually failed to prioritise child safety in their design”, resulting in “tragic consequences”.“That’s why it is vital this code requires children to be given the highest privacy settings by default and forces firms to act in the best interest of children,” the NSPCC’s associate head of child safety online Andy Burrows said.“This design code from the ICO is a really significant package of measures, but it must go hand in hand with the government following through on its commitment to enshrine in law a new duty of care on social networks and an independent regulator with powers to investigate and fine.”Lady Beeban Kidron, the chair of the 5Rights Foundation and who led the parliamentary debate about the creation of the recommendations, said the code represented “the beginning of a new deal between children and the tech sector”.“For too long we have failed to recognise children’s rights and needs online, with tragic outcomes,” she said.“I firmly believe in the power of technology to transform lives, be a force for good and rise to the challenge of promoting the rights and safety of our children. But in order to fulfil that role, it must consider the best interests of children, not simply its own commercial interests.”"},

A classic recent example here was  that occupies a wood bank by the path to the marsh. On 20 March it had an almost metropolitan sense of busyness. Hundreds, if not thousands, of insects were everywhere – flying, mating, burrowing, pollen-gathering and burying.The whole stretch was pitted with holes and 5mm-high mounds of “mine tailings” composed of the crumbly soil where the bees had dug out egg chambers, to which they trafficked leg-loads of sallow pollen as food for young.

Everyone has seen it, if only in their dreams, since it best registers at a subliminal level. It is the ground-hugging crucifer that loves curbs, curtilage, concrete, cracks and construction sites. The 2mm flowers create that white pointillist flush in early April, which brings unaccustomed delicacy to the crash barrier on a motorway’s central reservation. The flowers come and go over a two-week period, adding a ha’p’orth of reassurance that the world is turning truly.Then there is another kind of seasonality that is less regular but more dramatic. It’s the unexpected super-abundance of one particular plant. Sometimes it’s buttercups, and 2010 was one of their last big years. Spring 2019, however, belongs to the . I’ve never noticed such a flowering, but would love to understand what causes this change of behaviour in a plant that’s already widespread and highly adaptable.Red dead-nettle is a total misnomer.

A “diversity disaster” has contributed to flawed systems that perpetuate gender and racial biases found the survey, published by the AI Now Institute, of more than 150 studies and reports.The AI field, which is overwhelmingly white and male, is at risk of replicating or perpetuating historical biases and power imbalances, the report said. Examples cited include image recognition services making  of minorities, , and Amazon technology  with darker skin colors. The biases of systems built by the AI industry can be largely attributed to the lack of diversity within the field itself, the report said.“The industry has to acknowledge the gravity of the situation and admit that its existing methods have failed to address these problems,” Kate Crawford, an author on the report said. “The use of AI systems for the classification, detection, and prediction of race and gender is in urgent need of re-evaluation.”More than 80% of AI professors are men, and only 15% of AI researchers at Facebook and 10% of AI researchers at Google are women, the report said. The makeup of the AI field is reflective of “a larger problem across computer science, Stem fields, and even more broadly, society as a whole”, said Danaë Metaxa, a PhD candidate and researcher at Stanford focused on issues of internet and democracy. Women comprised only 24% of the field of computer and information sciences in 2015, . Only 2.5% of Google’s workforce is black, while Facebook and Microsoft are each at 4%, and little data exists on trans workers or other gender minorities in the AI field.“The urgency behind this issue is increasing as AI becomes increasingly integrated into society,” Metaxa said. “Essentially, the lack of diversity in AI is concentrating an increasingly large amount of power and capital in the hands of a select subset of people.”The use of AI systems for the classification, detection, and prediction of race and gender is in urgent need of re-evaluationVenture capital funding for AI startups , increasing 72% compared to 2017 to $9.33bn in funding. Active AI startups in the US increased 113% from 2015 to 2018. As more money and resources are invested into AI, companies have the opportunity to address the crisis as it unfolds, said Tess Posner, the chief executive officer of AI4ALL, a not-for-profit that works to increase diversity in the AI field. This lack of diversity must be addressed before AI reaches a “tipping point”, she said.“Every day that goes by it gets more difficult to solve the problem,” she said. “Right now we are in an exciting moment where we can make a difference before we see how much more complicated it can get later.”The report released on Tuesday cautioned against addressing diversity in the tech industry by fixing the “pipeline” problem, or the makeup of who is hired, alone. Men currently make up 71% of the applicant pool for AI jobs in the US, according to the 2018 AI Index, an independent report on the industry released annually. The AI institute suggested additional measures, including publishing compensation levels for workers publicly, sharing harassment and discrimination transparency reports, and changing hiring practices to increase the number of underrepresented groups at all levels.Google an artificial intelligence ethics council meant to oversee such issues just one week after announcing it in March. The Advanced Technology External Advisory Council (ATEAC) was attracted backlash inside and outside the company after it appointed the anti-LGBT advocate Kay Coles James.Posner noted that additional efforts to increase transparency around how algorithms are built and how they work  to fix the diversity problems in AI. This month, the US senators Cory Booker and Ron Wyden introduced the Algorithmic Accountability Act, a bill that would require algorithms used by companies that make more than $50m per year or hold information on at least 1 million users to be evaluated for biases.“The core of the problem is whether market forces are going to be sufficient for this to be fixed,” Posner said. “It’s going to take effort at all stages of AI and take change at cultural and procedural levels to solve this.”"},

Their details must also be entered on to central government’s new rogue landlord database for local authorities to share.English councils can also make discretionary entries on to the computer system. However, even using this less onerous method, the details of just four landlords have been placed on to the database in the 12 months since it went live – and their names cannot be accessed.The government has , and previously said it expected more than 600 of the worst offenders to be entered on to the database.The lack of use of banning orders and the rogue landlord database has been revealed after a freedom of information request filed by the Guardian in March.In its response to the FOI request, the Ministry of Housing,  and Local Government refused to reveal the identities of the four landlords now on the system, despite .Clive Betts, the chair of the parliament’s housing, communities and local government select committee, said: “Given what we know about the bad behaviour of a small number of landlords, it is very, very disappointing there aren’t more being prosecuted and banned.”Jacky Peacock, a director of the tenants’ charity Advice4Renters, added: “It’s pretty shocking if there are only four entries, 12 months after the database was established. Not a single banning order has been served on any rogue landlords who should be prevented from letting unsafe properties, after ignoring formal local authority notices and prosecutions.”Last October, after the Guardian and ITV News investigation revealed that the database was lying empty, the housing ministry said it expected “to see entries in the database increasing in the new year”.Telford and Wrekin was the first council to use the new database, with a discretionary entry made in December. It has since been followed by two discretionary entries from Camden and one from Oxford.Since April 2018, councils in England have been compelled to use the database to enter the details of rogue landlords who receive one of the government’s new banning orders. Local authorities can apply to the courts for an order to be issued to the sector’s worst offenders, which prevents a landlord letting their property either directly or through an agent.Local authorities can also choose to use the new database to enter the details of landlords who have been convicted of a “banning order offence” – a range of 14 offences from unlawful eviction and harassment to licensing breaches – or who have received two financial penalties for housing offences in the past year.Both banning orders and discretionary entries into the database only apply to offences committed since 6 April last year.The secrecy surrounding the central government database, and the sparsity of entries, contrasts sharply with a separate rogue landlord database run by the mayor of London’s office. The London version allows the public to view prosecutions of rogue landlords in the capital’s boroughs for a year after the conviction date.Heather Wheeler, the minister for housing and homelessness, said: “The rogue landlord database is targeted at the most prolific and serious offenders. It is a lengthy process to build cases and secure convictions and it is therefore not surprising that there are only a limited number at this stage.“We expect the number of entries to the database to increase during the year as only offences committed from April last year can be included and it can take time to secure convictions.”"},

I am sure I am not the only chief executive of a public body saying that Brexit is consuming bandwidth that could be usefully used on other things.”Over the next 12 months the FCA expects to spend £22m on Brexit preparations, down from £30m last year. Further delays to an article 50 leaving date could push that figure higher, adding to the organisation’s budget constraints.The FCA said it would sponsor debates with “key stakeholders so that we can keep pace with the developments taking place in the markets that we regulate and in wider society”.Banks and insurers are among a wide range of financial firms spending millions on artificial intelligence as a way to speed up decision-making and cut staff.Companies are also developing ways to buy and sell financial products using blockchain technology, which bypasses the traditional network established by banks over the past 40 years.The FCA report said: “Technology change brings risks to the operational resilience of our financial system and to the accountability of firms for the effects of decisions taken by machines.“It also brings risks to consumers who may be enabled to take decisions too quickly or with inadequate advice; may be exposed to more financial scams; or may struggle to participate in a technology-driven world.”It continued: “Technology change also brings risks to regulators, who may lag behind developments or lack skills and resources to match the changing risk landscape.“The global context is also changing as the United Kingdom leaves the European Union and we adapt to shifts in global power and growth. These changes can bring risks to UK markets and consumers if they become exposed to gaps in global regulation, if the changes lead to reduced competition in the UK or if they result in less effective cross-border coordination between regulators.”Bailey is also under pressure to strengthen City regulations after a series of scandals that left the FCA powerless to react. Last year it admitted it was  over the mistreatment of small business customers struggling after the banking crisis.The regulator said it lacked the powers to discipline RBS for misconduct, despite the “widespread inappropriate treatment” of up to 12,000 small businesses by the bank’s global restructuring group between 2008 and 2013.Bailey is due to report later this year on the FCA’s remit and whether it should be extended to cover a broader set of financial products and customers, including small businesses."},

Cowgill said JD was not immune to the problems facing UK store chains, “with lower footfall on many high streets, malls and retail parks combined with cost challenges from increasing minimum wage rates and rises in business rates”.Therefore, he added: “It is very pleasing that the core UK and Ireland sports fashion [shops], the most mature part of our group, have delivered a further increase in sales and profitability.” "},
{"title": "This scientist thinks she has the key to curb climate change: super plants", "time": "Wed 17 Apr 2019 ", "category": "Climate change", "tags": "Plants,Climate change,features", "content": "f this were a film about humanity’s last hope before climate change wiped us out, Hollywood would be accused of flagrant typecasting. That’s because  is too perfect for the role to be believable.The esteemed scientist – who has long banged the climate drum and now leads a project that could lower the Earth’s temperature – is perhaps the world’s leading botanist and is on the cusp of something so big that it could truly change our planet.She’s also a woman in her 60s who is fighting a disease sapping her very life. In 2004, Chory was diagnosed with Parkinson’s, which makes the timetable for success all the more tenuous.“We’re trying to do something that’s a huge, complicated thing even though it sounds so simple,” Chory says. “Plants evolved to suck up CO and they’re really good at it. And they concentrate it, which no machine can do, and they make it into useful materials, like sugar. They suck up all the CO, they fix it, then it goes back up into the atmosphere.”She is now working to design plants capable of storing even more carbon dioxide in their roots. Her  uses gene editing – via traditional horticulture and  – to do so. On a large scale, this could suck enough carbon out of the atmosphere to slow down climate change.This concept basically splices the genes of regular crops and everyday plants like beans, corn and cotton, with a new compound that makes them absorb more carbon. Their roots then transfer it to the soil to keep it there. This approach essentially supercharges what nature already does.“I get worked up when I talk about the project,” Chory tells me in an office at the Salk Institute, a revered bio research campus at the edge of the Pacific Ocean in southern California. Her desk is full of posies, awards, family photos and framed magazine covers from science journals. “We have to find a way to take CO out of the atmosphere and I think plants are the only way to do that affordably,” Chory says.“I feel like I have the weight of the world on my shoulders,” she says, letting out a laugh. “It is a lot of pressure.”Born in Boston to Lebanese parents, the third of six children, Chory received a PhD studying photosynthetic bacteria at the University of Illinois. She spent her postdoctoral years as a Harvard Medical School researcher, then joined the institute in 1988. Along the way, she’s discovered how plants respond to everything from light and environment to how they regulate size and growth.“It’s a philosophical issue, too,” she says, explaining why so many kick the can of global warming. “If I take pain now, maybe my great-grandchildren might see a benefit. People choose no pain now, that’s why we’ve done nothing about climate change.”Every now and then as we speak, Chory’s symptoms pop up like an uninvited guest, another stark reminder of time. Struggling to maintain control and ever aware of the implied humor in her movements, she doesn’t shy from the elephant in the room.“When I get excited I really get moving,” she mock-apologizes, letting out a coy chuckle. “I’m a lot better on Saturdays.” She pauses, collects her thoughts. “That’s why I want to do something that won’t cause pain to people. You never know when you’re making a global change. I don’t know if we can do it, but we have to try.”Temperatures are already at alarming levels even if we reach the Paris agreement of curbing a rise of 2C. The world is headed for major upheaval, it’s merely a question of the scale. If we have any chance as a species, Salk contends, it’s with big ideas like this.Right now, the institute is negotiating with seed companies and prepping tests on nine agricultural crops to introduce Ideal  on farms around the world. Field-testing begins later this year with wheat, soybeans, corn and cotton.Developing these Ideal Plants is step one in the Harnessing Plants Initiative, which amplifies root systems and production of suberin – which is essentially cork, or the rind on your cantaloupe, the magic key to plants holding more of that carbon – before transferring these genetic traits to row and cover crops. Given the right resources, and funding, prototypes of each crop are expected to be ready in the next five years.A $2m gift by Howard Newman, a Salk board member and private equity veteran who has invested in oil and gas, jump-started the project last June. In April, Salk received a TED Audacious grant totaling $35m to support the plan.Chory says these new plants will have deeper and stronger root systems that will also stop erosion, another byproduct of warming temperatures, which will make soil more healthy and boost production. When normal plants die, they release large amounts of CO back into the air; when Ideal Plants die, significantly less CO will be re-released due to more carbon being stored in deeper roots and soil for longer periods, and suberin’s natural ability as a carbon polymer to resist short-term decomposition.The first two meters of the Earth’s soil holds over three times the amount of carbon as the atmosphere, and can hold even more. Fossil fuel use was predicted to rise nearly . Each year, we produce 18 more gigatons of CO than the Earth can currently handle; Salk believes their solution can achieve as much as a 46% annual reduction in excess CO emissions produced by humans.It’s an extremely ambitious idea full of so many unknowns – how to get global buy-in from farmers, how many years will it take for plants to reach maturity and will it then be too late, how will mother nature react to such genetic modification and how will these crops taste – that none of Salk’s brains have the answers to.The institute was founded in 1960 by Jonas Salk, a biologist who discovered the cure for polio in 1955, two years before my own father’s identical twin died of the disease in communist Romania, a place where politics kept science at bay.Standing at the edge of the seaside campus designed by Louis Kahn, a sprawl of ominous cement towers and dramatic ocean views, it all feels straight out of the mind of Philip K Dick. Part Gattaca, part Logan’s Run, it’s easy to see why  have been .But there’s also an optimism in these labs that feels so far from the stark structures and climate narrative I’m used to. Many scientists have told me their role is something akin to historian, documenting the last days of a species or system. Not so here.“There is hope in dreams, in imagination and in the courage of those who dare to make dreams into reality,” Jonas Salk once said.Inside these modernist blocks, they’re dreamers too, but rooted in reality. The biological research center, funded by government grants and private donors, has spent decades inching towards cures for everything from cancer to Alzheimer’s. In 1968, Robert W Holley, Salk Cancer Center’s founding director, won a Nobel prize; in 1975, Institute staff won another Nobel, and again in 1977 and 2002.More recently, Chory was awarded a $3m  for discovering how plants optimize their growth, development and cellular structure to transform sunlight into chemical energy.I see the optimism on a tour with Dr Joseph Noel, a biochemist focused on harnessing suberin, the project’s linchpin. He shows me seed-planting robots, which can bang out a day’s work in the time it would take a human weeks; state-of-the-art grow rooms capable of simulating almost any environmental condition; greenhouses sitting atop dramatic bluffs. All the while he breaks down the importance of cork. “It’s a spongy barrier that helps a plant regulate water coming in and out, gas exchange coming in and out. Think of it like a protective plastic around certain cells in the plant.”The institute’s founder, Jonas, once said “our greatest responsibility is to be good ancestors,” and I think about the quote’s relevance as Noel shows me rows of simulation rooms full of cattails, marsh grasses, legumesand weed-like  all in various states of growth as LEDs shine and humid air blasts while I take notes.“Instead of just growing in a greenhouse or artificial lights in a lab, we wanted to have the ability to simulate a particular climactic zone: quality of light, seasonal changes, cloud cover, temperatures,” Noel says.Since  “can go from seed to seed in six weeks” and its genome is entirely sequenced and resembles so many other species, the little mustard flower has become the project’s veritable Rosetta Stone.“It’s very easy to change the genetics of it on a massive scale,” he continues. “If we change a particular gene, we can find out if the roots get deeper, do they get more extensive, does the suberin content change. Their early ancestors have been doing photosynthesis for about 2.8bn years.”Without plants, life as we know it wouldn’t exist. The question is whether these ones will become our saviors.There’s a growing field of carbon dioxide removal projects which include machines pulling C0 out of the sky, known as direct air capture. There’s Bill Gates-backed Carbon Engineering and the Zurich startup Climeworks, and about 20 commercial carbon capture and storage facilities worldwide, but they’re price prohibitive. There have been notable failures: Sir Richard Branson tried a $25m prize for carbon removal but never found a solution. Carbon removal initiatives are also criticized for preserving the status quo and big energy business models.“Ultimately, we all know that humanity’s response to climate change will, as the Ideal Plant project states, make or break our future,” says David Stern, the president and CEO of the , a leading plant research facility in New York, who calls Chory a fearless, creative and open-minded scientist. “Given the complexities and scale of the problem, many types of solutions will be needed. Sequestration is undoubtedly one of them.”One big problem, Stern notes, is winning hearts and minds. Genetically modifying organisms saving the planet might be a tough sell in an era when GMO has become the antithesis for the green, organic movement.“While they are not proposing traditional transgenic lines nor are they proposing to do their work in food crops, the issue will still come up,” Stern adds.Chory maintains that plants have been modified for millennia – selecting the best strains to cultivate and taking a hand in their development is a form of genetic modification, after all – and the nutritional and yield values of such tweaked products still outweigh the drawbacks. Salk doesn’t introduce foreign genetic material in its plants, unlike many GMO products. The European Union outlawing modified organisms, plus crops with Crispr traits (as a result, the plants might not make it to the EU). Another issue is seed pricing and getting it to farmers around the world, so the wide-scale use is in question.“As with any GMO crop the big question is how do the changes affect nutritional quality and whether small farmers in developing countries would be able to buy the seeds on a large enough scale to make a difference?” wonders  a senior biologist who studies land-bird seed dispersal at the San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory.Right now, the Mississippi delta in Louisiana is a test zone for a first batch of Ideal Plants in the wild, a major step to see if improved root systems can mitigate sea level rise. Still, Salk researchers are sober to the odds.“Any restoration effort, unlike our  that can grow from seed to seed in six weeks, these systems you plant them and then you wait. You wait a long time,” Noel laments. “We can’t afford to have these experiments not work.”Are we past the point of no return? “The world’s not going to be the world we live in right now,” Chory says. “I don’t know if we’re going to eliminate the whole human species, but I think if we don’t do something soon we will go that route. The misery index of humidity plus the heat will get so high mammals can’t live.”The  says the tipping point is here.“I don’t think it’s here yet,” Chory counters. Still, she concedes that “migration is already happening. Canada is going to make out well in this. The United States is not. We’re going to have a lot of changes in our agriculture.”She adds: “The farmers are the ones we really have to convince. We can’t continue to farm the way we farm any more. It can feed 8 to 10 billion people but 50 years from now, there won’t be any good soil left so you’re just putting the disaster off.”Chory glances at a picture of her daughter, Katie.“Look at me, I’m 64 years old. I’m not going to be around to see this project go to fruition, I’m not going to be working at Salk, probably. That urgency is there. The climate urgency is there. Every week there’s a new climate disaster. How can we get there? We can’t really get there any faster. I don’t know if we can do it, but I want to be part of the solution. I don’t just want to sit around and complain.”"},

Ahead of us on the path, a pair of mottled  broke cover, grunting dissatisfaction. They waddled determinedly away – reluctant to use up energy to fly – on feathered feet, bright against the wet vegetation.Further along, we came across small hollows in the snow where they had been roosting overnight. The ptarmigan will dig down for shelter and sit atop their own fibrous droppings, using them as a sort of bedstraw.These birds are endemic to the sparse, tundra-like habitat of the Cairngorm plateau, and can be found there year-round. Like the mountain hare, they change their clothing to match the seasons. But it is difficult to match the fast-changing countenance of the Scottish hills, which shifts from the dark tones of exposed rock to glittering snowbank and back again in the space of a few days.At the summit of Cairn Gorm, the rocks were feathered with hard frost. The wind came battering in from the east, making me stagger. Across the iced-over band of Loch Avon, a happy surprise: . Dainty, white-bellied and marked out in black and buff, they flitted from rock to rock. Nothing like them to put you in a wintery mood.Because it is still winter, on the high ground at least. After we plodded home I checked the conditions, out of habit. All change up there: deep banks, white-out, snowpack, wind slab. The season’s last gasp. Those crampons might have been useful after all."},

Luckily, though the blaze consumed the gothic marvel’s roof and spire, firefighters saved the church’s foundation, towers, relics and stained glass windows. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, has pledged to restore the cathedral, and French tycoons and businessmen have already pledged over $700m to the project.The French firefighters are heroes, Colbert said, which means of course Donald Trump had to . As news of the fire spread on Monday, the president tweeted: “Perhaps flying water tankers could be used to put it out. Must act quickly!”The French civil security agency did not respond directly, instead tweeting: “All means are being used” to extinguish the fire, “except for water-bombing aircrafts which, if used, could lead to the collapse of the entire structure of the cathedral”.“For firefighters, they really know how to give a sick burn,” Colbert said.Trump’s week could be headed downhill, Colbert continued, since the full Mueller report is set to be released on Thursday. “I for one can’t wait – this is my Game of Thrones, in that I’m pretty sure there are some boobs in it.”The report was supposed to be released on Tuesday, but the justice department delayed it to Thursday with no explanation. “I have a feeling they’re hoping to bury it over the holiday weekend,” Colbert surmised, “because if there’s one thing Easter is famous for, it’s things staying buried.”In Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel gave an update on the 2020 presidential race, which is already in full swing. On Tuesday, , the former governor of Massachusetts, announced he was challenging Trump for the Republican nomination since, he said, “it’s time to return to the principles of Lincoln, equality, dignity and opportunity for all”.“Has he been out of the country for a few years?” Kimmel joked. “That’s never happening again.”Weld was a well-respected governor with a strong legal background, Kimmel continued, but “unfortunately, never hosted a reality show, never bankrupted a casino, never got his head stuck in a bucket of fried chicken during sex. These are things that have to be on your résumé now.”On the Democratic side, businessman  announced his candidacy in Washington DC on Tuesday. “Do you know Andrew Yang?

Chant my name!”“Is that a real candidate or somebody’s stoner nephew running for prom king?” Kimmel asked.Meanwhile, the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has raised the most money of the Democratic candidates – $18.2m so far, “zero of which has been spent on personal grooming”. Sanders also appeared recently in a town hall on Fox News, which did not please Trump, who tweeted his disdain. “He gets really jealous when his Fox makes other friends, he really does,” Kimmel said.“And speaking of jealous,” Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, and North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, plan to hold a summit next week without Trump. In other words, “all of Trump’s BFFs are hanging out without him,” Kimmel said. “I guess Kim finally realized that if he wants to make a deal with America, he has to go to the top.”"},

He and his family have moved to the country to avoid noises that trigger pain, nausea and dizziness.In his evidence Goldscheider stated he was now “unable to bear being around noise”.Goldscheider won his case a year ago but the ROH, supported by the Association of British Orchestras, the Society of London Theatre and the UK Theatre Association, took it to appeal. They argued it could have “disturbing implications” for all live music performance.Lawyers for the ROH said the original ruling failed to distinguish between the industrial noise of a factory and “one of the greatest artistic institutions in the world, for whom ‘noise’ was a product”.The ROH and its supporters said that “all music-making in the UK” might have to be curtailed because of the ruling.But Sir Brian Leveson, sitting with Lord Justice Bean and Lord Justice McCombe, rejected this, saying: “For my part, I simply do not accept that this cataclysmic scenario represents a proper understanding of the consequences of this decision.”He said Goldscheider’s injuries were “all foreseeable and reasonably preventable”, adding: “What the case does underline is the obligation placed on venues to comply with the requirements of the legislation.”He said: “The national and international reputation of the ROH is not and should not be affected by this judgment.”The judges backed the ROH in its contention that the wearing of ear defenders at all times by players during rehearsals and performances was not practicable.Alex Beard, the chief executive of the ROH, said the company was pleased that point had been accepted.He said: “The original high court ruling, which stipulated that hearing protection must be worn by orchestral musicians at all times, was widely acknowledged by the live-music and theatre industries as completely impractical with potentially devastating and far-reaching consequences for the entire sector, and we are pleased that this unworkable solution has been overturned.“We are, however, disappointed by other aspects of the appeal court’s ruling and will work closely with our insurers and legal team to explore our next steps.”In March last year, Mrs Justice Nicola Davies ruled in Goldscheider’s favour on the issues of breach of duty and causation of injury. She found there was a “clear factual and causal link” between the identified breaches of the regulations and the high level of noise at the rehearsal.Damages have yet to be assessed. During the earlier trial, lawyers said Goldscheider’s lost earnings alone amounted to £750,000."},

{"title": "Notre Dame and the culture it inspired – from Matisse to the Muppets", "time": "Tue 16 Apr 2019 ", "category": null, "tags": "Culture,Architecture,Art,Games,Notre Dame,Television,France,features", "content": "As Notre Dame Cathedral’s majestic spire tumbled into the inferno on Monday night, live newsreaders around the world decried the tragic loss of this 12th-century marvel. The great timber roof – nicknamed “the forest” for the thousands of trees used in its beams – was gone, the rose windows feared melted, the heart of Paris destroyed forever. What few realised in the heat of the shocking footage was that much of what was ablaze was a 19th-century fantasy. Like most buildings of this age,  is the sum of centuries of restorations and reinventions, a muddled patchwork of myth and speculation.Standing as a sturdy hulk on the banks of the Seine, the great stone pile has never been the most elegant or commanding of the ancient cathedrals, but it became the most famous. Begun in 1163, it was larger than any gothic church before it, employing some of the first flying buttresses to allow taller, thinner walls and larger expanses of glazing – including the spectacular rose windows that projected great cosmic wheels of colour into the luminous interior. “Where would [one] find … such magnificence and perfection, so high, so large, so strong, clothed round about with such a multiple variety of ornaments?” asked John of Jandun, in his 1323 Treatise on the Praises of Paris. Five hundred years later, the gothic revivalist architect  fainted when he first encountered Notre Dame, so overwhelmed was he by its beauty.The only solace one might take from the horrific fire is that it is merely the latest chapter in a long and violent history of destruction and repair. The cathedral was heavily damaged by rioting Huguenots in the 16th century, remodelled by successive kings and roundly plundered during the French Revolution, when the 28 statues of biblical figures on the west façade, mistaken for French kings, were ritually beheaded.It was ’s 1831 novel Notre-Dame de Paris (translated as The Hunchback of Notre Dame) that brought the cathedral’s plight to widespread attention, raising alarm about the “mutilations, amputations [and] dislocations” of the structure, and making gothic architecture touch the popular imagination in a way it never had before. His writing spurred on calls for a full restoration, eventually undertaken by , who was just 30 when he won the commission with Jean-Baptiste-Antoine Lassus in 1845. Over the next 25 years, he would mould Notre Dame according to his own romantic vision, adding elaborate layers of ornament and decorative statues of entirely his own invention.His enormous spire, made of 500 tons of wood and 250 tons of lead, was a far cry from the previous tower (removed in 1786 due to instability), modelled instead on a 19th-century spire in Orléans. Around this great , he concocted a fantastical menagerie of apostles and mythical creatures – most of which appear to have been saved from the flames, having already been removed for restoration.History hasn’t been kind to Viollet-le-Duc’s work. Victorian architect William Burges called him a “disastrous restorationist”, while Charles Hiatt’s 1902 account of the cathedral’s redecorated interior bemoaned that “the colour confuses our appreciation of the fine lines of the architecture, and it is frequently restless and irritating where it should be most reposeful”. Critic  passed a damning judgment on Notre Dame in the 1960s, calling it “one of the most pessimistic buildings in the world [with] no hope of change, and no glimmer of ultimate purpose,” adding that “Viollet-le-Duc’s musty and self-righteous cackle can be heard all over the building”.Yet the echoes of this gleeful, overripe cackle are exactly what made Notre Dame so seductive to the imagination of the millions of tourists who flocked here each year – and who will no doubt continue to do so when it is rebuilt, with yet another layer of creative interpretation added to the rich historical collage. In 1904,  wrote an article for Le Figaro whose title, The Death of Cathedrals, now takes on painful resonance. Proust, who so loved gothic ecclesiastical architecture he would inveigle his beloved chauffeur-lover Alfredo Agostinelli to light up church facades with headlamps so he could study their stones, one evening threw a fur-lined coat over his nightdress so he could spend two hours gazing at Notre Dame’s portal of Saint Anne.The death Proust was lamenting was not so much sacrifice to flames as the insufferable consequence he inferred from a contemporary governmental plan that allowed cathedrals like Notre Dame to be converted into “museum, concert hall, or casino.” As his biographer Jean-Yves Tadié points out, though agnostic and Jewish, Proust was so fired by the passion inculcated in him for gothic architecture by John Ruskin that he couldn’t bear the thought of Catholic churches being thus repurposed. His great novel, À la Recherche du Temps Perdu, revels in lapidary descriptions of churches, great and small.Sigmund Freud, another secular Jew and contemporary of Proust’s, was similarly entranced by Notre Dame. The first time he saw it, in 1885, Freud said he had “a sensation I never had before.” Thereafter, between studying with neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot at Salpêtrière Hospital, he returned to Notre Dame “every free afternoon” to be in its presence. “I have never seen anything so movingly serious and sombre,” Freud said.But Notre Dame has an even more sombre incarnation, one that reeks of death and damnation. In 1866, Baudelaire published  (Scraps), a collection of incidental verse including six censored poems from the 1857 edition of , one of whose poems, , includes the line: “The finest trick of the devil is to persuade you that he does not exist.” Its frontispiece includes a hideous skeleton, described by  as “symbolising the tree of good and evil, in whose feet grow flowers representing the seven deadly sins. Angels and cherubs are flying high above around a medallion of the poet carried away by a chimera.”The artist of that frontispiece, Félicien Rops, perhaps inspired by Baudelaire, made that devil’s existence sickeningly plain in his 1882 image  (‘Satan sowing seeds among the wheat’). In it, Michaelides relates, a gigantic Satan is crossing , casting seeds of discord from his right hand. The seeds, misogynistically enough, are women. Worse, his right foot rests on – perhaps even crushes – the twin towers of Notre Dame.But it is Hugo’s Hunchback through which literature bends the knee most eloquently to the cathedral. Hugo wrote it in part to catalyse interest in the gothic building, which had fallen out of fashion in Paris. At one point in the vast novel, the villain, Judge Claude Frollo, directs his visitors to look away from a book on his desk to the massive silhouette of Notre Dame Cathedral. “This will kill that,” he remarks. The idea is that the printing press will destroy the cathedral, that the renaissance will murder religion, silence the eloquence of churches. “Small things overcome great ones,” , “the book will kill the building.” For Hugo, Stonehenge, the Parthenon and indeed Notre Dame are “books of stone” pregnant with meaning.Not that all Notre Dame is as venerable as we might suppose. Eric Hazan, the city’s great historian, wrote in his recent book A Walk Through Paris a passage that seems to have been composed for tourists arriving on the Eurostar. “It is a shame that no one stops to contemplate [the facade of the ],” he writes, “whereas crowds throng in front of the facade of Notre Dame, whose statuary is no older than that of the railway station.” The station’s facade is, Hazan argues, a masterpiece. While the world awaits the rebuilding of Notre Dame then, there are consolations. There are numberless postwar movies set in Paris that use Notre Dame as an establishing shot, embedded as part of the city’s legendary fabric and its furniture, the camera sometimes noticing it just subliminally. Paris is habitually a signifier for the secular world of romance and adventure, so using the cathedral more explicitly is not an obvious choice. Jean-Paul Belmondo reads the paper with Notre Dame in the background in Godard’s ; Leslie Caron and Gene Kelly dance in Notre Dame’s shadow in An American In Paris; Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn walk past it as they talk about murder in .The most stunning – and now eerily prescient – “movie tourist” use of Notre Dame is Richard Linklater’s  in which the reunited lovers Jesse and Céline ponder the cathedral and Céline says: “But you have to think that Notre Dame will be gone one day …”But of course the most sensational use of Notre Dame is in  in 1939, based on the Victor Hugo novel (there were two earlier silent versions and many remakes since, including a Disney animation). Charles Laughton is the poignantly lonely and lovelorn Quasimodo, the cathedral’s bellringer who rescues Esmeralda (Maureen O’Hara) from public hanging for witchcraft by swinging down Tarzan-like from one of his bell-ropes and bringing her back to the bell tower for sanctuary. That is: the North Tower, whose ancient oak frame has now been destroyed, and the fate of its four immense bells still uncertain.The film breathtakingly reverses the usual movie grammar of Notre Dame; instead of incuriously glimpsing the cathedral on the skyline, we are around and inside it, getting a stunning reverse view of Paris from the tower – that is, the fake medieval Paris built in the San Fernando Valley – as the agonised Quasimodo looks out over the teeming city with all its drama and compares himself to the gargoyles he stands next to. The movie was instantly felt to be a symbol of anti-Nazi defiance.Later, Paul WS Anderson’s version of  staged a swordfight on the cathedral’s roof, and Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s whimsical romance Amélie had the heroine’s mother bizarrely killed by a suicide jumping from Notre Dame. During their ominous conversation about Notre Dame in Before Sunset, Jesse and Céline talk about Nazi plans to destroy the city before the Allied advance. In René Clément’s , Orson Welles plays the Swedish consul who dissuades the Nazi governor from anything of the sort — because Notre Dame has to be saved. In The Muppet Show in 1981, the show’s opening number featured a blue headed, green haired chap called Mulch performing the role of Quasimodo. He climbed to the bell tower of Notre Dame to sing a love song. “The bells are ringing,” he began gamely, “for me and gargoyle / The birds are singing for me and gargoyle.”And then, in unexpected application of the Pygmalion myth, the love of his life, though no looker, unpeeled herself from the parapet and mutated from stone into a singing puppet. “Everybody’s been knowing to a wedding they’re going,” she sang. “And for weeks they’ve been stowing days of labour and toil.” And then some other hideous troll-like figures, sculpted into the parapet below, came to life and sang the chorus.Though the episode’s special guest was Debbie Harry, her performance of Blondie’s One Way or Another was no match for this reworking of the 1917 standard For Me and My Gal, best known from its outing in the Gene Kelly 1942 film of the same name. Its gag worked through the same hilarious principle of the Rodgers and Hart song Manhattan, with its couplet: “The city’s clamour can never spoil / The dreams of a boy and goil.” Though why French gargoyles sing in New York accents is beyond me.Television’s relationship with the Parisian landmark has switched vertiginously from comedy to gothic horror. The 2016 Simpsons episode To Courier With Love has the family flying to Paris because Homer has to work as a courier transporting an endangered Amazon blue constrictor snake into the country for reasons too bizarre to get into. One night in Paris, while Bart is fishing in the Seine, and Lisa, you’d suspect, debating philosophy at Les Deux Magots, Homer dons the proverbial existentialist turtleneck and with Marge strolls past the cathedral. Admiring the gargoyles, Homer remarks: “That’s from back when religion knew how to scare the crap out of you”, clearly not knowing that the Muppets had taught us those stones could come to life and sing of love like native New Yorkers.And yet, Homer had a point. Notre Dame’s function on television has often been to scare the crap out of its audience or, what is the same thing, provide backdrop for gothic hokum. In Jo, the English language, Paris-set police procedural seriesstarring Jean Reno as the eponymous Joachim Saint-Clair, for instance, one episode starts with a body found beaten and strangled under the Last Judgment portal of Notre Dame. The victim’s ears have been pierced and his face tilted so that his dead eyes are aimed at a figure of an angel blowing his trumpet to wake the dead for the final judgment. Jo’s theory is that the killer has made the the victim symbolically deaf to the angels’ trumpet, suggesting the victim wasn’t worth God’s mercy.But the future for Notre Dame on television is uncertain. Last year, actor Tom Hollander’s production company enlisted screenwriter Andrew Davies . Hollander himself told Radio Times he wanted to play Quasimodo, though he’d equally be good as Esmeralda. I’ve a hunch (so very sorry) that this adaptation, if it goes ahead, will take on a very different resonance now. To understand the artistic wonder that is Notre Dame you have to accept it as a synthesis of medieval faith and modern fantasy. Viollet-le-Duc crowded the real Notre Dame with grinning, devilish gargoyles just as Hugo populated his fictional one with a deaf bell ringer and his tormentors. This intermixing of a genuine gothic cathedral with the 19th-century dream of what gothic should be has put Notre Dame at the heart of the modern imagination. It’s the artistic embodiment of Paris, the centre of medieval European thought and culture which in the 1800s became the birthplace of modern art.For at least 300 years before Viollet-le-Duc saved Notre Dame, medieval cathedrals had been shunned. When London’s gothic cathedral St Paul’s was destroyed in the Great Fire of London it was replaced with a trendy new domed edifice by Christopher Wren. No-one this morning is calling for a new Notre Dame to be built by France’s contemporary architectural star Jean Nouvel. That’s because Viollet-le-Duc, who also restored churches across  and the lovely walled city Carcassonne, taught us what makes medieval architecture so magical.Almost a thousand years after its original creation Notre Dame still speaks to usIt is the human plenitude, the sense of hundreds of anonymous masons working in humble collectivism, and thousands of people across time sharing our awe for what they built, that gives Notre Dame its mystique. A great cathedral is a vast living organism. It’s like being inside a whale, the vaulting a sublime rib cage above you. Unlike a symmetrical classical building a gothic cathedral is not an image of order but living disorder where flying buttresses sprout, mighty columns soar, lofty galleries conceal prayers and plotters.Viollet-le-Duc loved the monsters at the edge of medieval Christianity, basing the gargoyles and chimeras that cover his restored stonework on works in French museums. His macabre Notre Dame is the birthplace of French modern culture from Baudelaire’s poetry and Rodin’s Gates of Hell to  of its unmistakable facade in pink morning light. Yet under all its accretions, the heart of Notre Dame is truly medieval. Gothic architecture was born in Paris. Abbot Suger of Saint-Denis, on the French capital’s outskirts, invented this art style in the early 1100s to glorify God in a spectacular new way. To let in sacred light, gothic builders created stained glass windows – and to make space for those, they raised buildings higher than ever before. Flying buttresses and the pointed arch redistributed the structure’s weight so cunningly that huge areas of wall could be replaced with glass. If Notre Dame survives it will be because the flying buttresses did their job.It was hard to resist the sense of miracle when a photograph of the interior showed . Another image shows holes in the stone vaulting – but the interior is still the sculpted space the medieval masons made. As it seemed Notre Dame was perishing last night, I was heartbroken. But unless there’s fatal structural damage yet to be revealed, it seems the stones of Paris are holding up. And everything else can be replaced. A cathedral can endure the loss of its stained glass and other fineries, as has happened in Britain where all our cathedrals were vandalised in the Reformation and civil war.It’s precisely this endurance that makes medieval architecture so special. Almost a thousand years after its original creation Notre Dame still speaks to us. Like cave paintings, it connects us with some primal aesthetic urge. Now our time faces a challenge. Do we still have in us the love, idealism and skill that enabled Viollet-le-Duc and his workers to recreate a gothic masterpiece? If we can reawaken the creativity this building embodies it will be a great moment of artistic renewal for today’s Europe. Music has been part of Notre Dame’s history since its foundation. Some of the earliest known European composers, working in Paris around 1160 to 1250, wrote music for the liturgy each week even as the great cathedral was being built around them. Collectively these composers are known as the Notre Dame School. Their names are mostly forgotten. Through a 13th-century English scholar, known as Anonymous IV, we know of the two most important: Léonin and .Their lasting significance was to write down and develop western musical techniques which had previously only been extemporised. Their polyphonic motets (written for more than once voice) replaced the single line of Gregorian chant, common up to that point. The Magnus Liber Organi (“great organum book”), a collection of Notre Dame works, is one of the greatest single achievements in medieval art, a cornerstone of European music for the next three centuries. Léonin, according to Anonymous IV, made the collection, Pérotin later revised it. The American minimalist  in his vocal and electronics work Proverb.Another globally important strand of musical life for Notre Dame is the historic organ, central to the flowering of French organ music. The current instrument, spectacular in size and symphonic sound, was originally built by the leading French organ maker Aristide Cavaillé-Coll in 1868. It has survived two world wars and was substantially improved in 1963 and again in 1990. Played on five keyboards and pedals, it has nearly 8,000 stops and an advanced computer system.Several French composers have held the position of organist at Notre Dame including Louis Vierne who collapsed and died at the organ console after a recital to 3,000 people. The most idiosyncratic, quirky and brilliant in modern times was , improviser, composer, pedagogue and one of the greatest organists of the 20th century. All great cathedrals are spectacular and dramatic, but the specific theatricality of Notre Dame is bound up in the mythology of Victor Hugo’s great novel. Hugo himself was thinking of the opera house soon after publication in 1831 and duly cooperated with composer Louise Bertin on a grand opera in four acts, .This flopped, but five more romantic operas soon followed. Apart from the films and television series, there have been countless theatre versions, too, in recent years ranging from , through Strathcona Theatre Company’s small-scale touring edition in 2001. One forgotten musical was based on the Disney film, and several ballets have included Roland Petit’s for the Paris Opera Ballet in 1965.But the main theatrical stab at the story in recent years was the 1998 , a French Europop concert that provided a hit soundtrack for Céline Dion after it was premiered at the Palais des Congres, a building conceived in an alternative plane to the cathedral’s scale and sublimity.Our Francophile producer, the late Michael White, presented the show at the Dominion in London in 2000, with Tina Arena and blocks of concrete misrepresenting the cathedral. And it’s this powerfully ingratiating score – by Richard Cocciante – with gloriously banal book and lyrics by Luc Plamondon, that ripped up the Coliseum only a few weeks ago with an acrobatic chorus of Parisian low-life decked out in primary colour satin trews and boleros.Most critics in 2000 panned the show, no doubt hoping to be right after being, mostly, wrong when Les Misérables (1980 in Paris) opened here in 1985. It was, they said “a load of old bells”, “all bats and no belfry”. Sheridan Morley decried Quasimodo’s disabled backing group who scuttled up and down the cathedral bell tower “in a futile attempt to escape the show”. Frankly, it gave him the hump.Notre Dame itself really needs no dramatising. It has David’s paintings, stained glass, the magnificent organ and an impasto of ceremonies and coronations that should, God and the restoration willing, run for ever. In video games, architecture is more than set-dressing. When a player can move through a piece of art, examine it through touch, movement and interaction as well as visually, the composition of virtual spaces and buildings becomes as vital to the experience as code, sound and visual design. Game designers’ art, like architects’, is that of expressing something through a space.A great many video game creatives show a weakness for the imposing beauty of gothic architecture in their work. Echoes of Notre Dame can be seen in games from eldritch horror  to the arch-fantasy . For , a historical game set during the French Revolution, an environmental artist named Caroline Miousse spent the best part of two years recreating Notre Dame Cathedral in a virtual 18th-century Paris, working from old maps of the city, sketches and photographs. Notre Dame didn’t have its spires at that time, but in the game they are there, a concession to the modern player’s mental image of the iconic building. You can climb right to the top of the cathedral and survey the city below; inside, you can see the paintings that were hanging on the walls 250 years ago. Experiencing the cathedral in-game having seen it in the flesh evokes a powerful, intimate sense of deja vu.

For three years, the president has cited “a fake audit that definitely does not exist” to justify keeping his tax returns under wraps, Meyers said, but that probably won’t hold against a recent House ways and means committee demand that the IRS release them.Noting that “the president always sounds like a spam email asking you for your social security number”, Meyers suggested that Congress “would have more luck getting his tax returns if they just used his syntax in their request”.“Mr President (some would say best President), We are WRITING to request your tax returns,” Meyers wrote for Congress. “Are willing to send truck to pick up as they are so big, massive even (!) from your many large and successful businesses (WOW!!!).”Regardless, it’s up the IRS, not Trump, whether or not the House demand is fulfilled. Yet the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, circuited the Sunday talkshows to blast congressional Democrats for the request, claiming they were too dumb to understand Trump’s returns.“OK, now, this is what she wants – she’s trolling us,” Meyers explained. “She wants us to get all mad and riled up and point out all the ways that Trump is actually the idiot because that’s their only move: to take whatever we say about Trump and turn it back on us. And we’re just too dignified for that. We’re not going to stoop to her level, and I’m just kidding and here’s a bunch of dumb shit the president has said and done.” He cut to a compilation of Trump’s more meme-able gaffes – toilet paper on his shoe, mispronouncing “future” as “furniture”, calling the Apple CEO, Tim Cook, “Tim Apple” and describing a hurricane as “very, very wet”.In what Meyers described as another dumb move, Trump attempted to further incite outrage over immigration by floating the idea of forcibly moving migrants from the Mexican border to so-called sanctuary cities.“So that’s your brilliant chess move: to send poor migrant families fleeing poverty and violence to cities that actually want to welcome them,” Meyers said. “This is one of the dumbest attempted trolls I’ve ever heard. We’re all actively volunteering to take in more refugees and Trump is like: ‘Oh, I know – I’ll let them take in more refugees. That’ll show them!’”Over in Los Angeles,  recapped Donald Trump’s enthusiastic reaction to Tiger Woods’s win at the Masters this weekend; in a tweet, Trump said he planned to award Woods the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his comeback in golf and in life. Or maybe for a few more reasons, Kimmel said. “I know why Donald Trump is giving Tiger Woods the Presidential Medal of Freedom: it’s the closest he can get to giving himself the Presidential Medal of Freedom.“Tiger Woods and the measles are back. What a time to be alive!”In honor of tax day, Kimmel also pointed out that “we still haven’t seen the president’s taxes.”. The reason for that, at least according to Sarah Sanders, is that Congress is too dumb to interpret them. Today’s congressmen and women “are [not] smart enough to look through the thousands of pages that I would assume that President Trump’s taxes will be”, Sanders said.“That’s interesting,” Kimmel responded. “Did you know she clips her toenails with her teeth?”"},

And it’s pretty evil when it’s preached to children by crazy teachers.”In a , Humphries defended fellow Australian Geoffrey Rush against allegations of professional misconduct, which Rush denies and has recently successfully sought damages for in a defamation lawsuit. “I don’t think it’s fair,” Humphries said, describing touching “some Sheila on stage” as “part of the job”. The allegations Humphries refers to were not substantiated during Rush’s defamation trial.Winning the award in 2017, Hannah Gadsby said: “I don’t agree with a lot of the things  has said recently … It is not something I will walk past. With full respect, I would like to accept this award just for me.”She expanded on the sentiment in a 2018 tweet, claiming “Humphries … has completely lost the ability to read the room.”Barry Humphries loves those who hold power, hates vulnerable minorities and has completely lost the ability to read the room. Thats not a comedian, thats an irrelevant, inhumane dick biscuit of the highest order.To the Guardian on Tuesday, Provan said that Humphries comments “were a factor” in the decision, but that “for some time the Festival and comedy community have discussed renaming the award”.Comedian Zoe Coombs Marr, who won the award in 2016, praised the decision on Tuesday, calling it a “massive win” for comedy.“I’m so proud of the comedy festival for doing what Barry Humphries himself seems unable to do – listening to criticism, moving with the times and stepping up to the plate to ultimately make things more inclusive for everyone,” she said in a statement. “Good bloody on them! … If this change means more new & diverse voices are welcomed in, then in the end, that’s a massive win for comedy.”A number of media outlets, including  and , have linked the name change to Humphries’ comments.Humphries, Gadsby and Workman have been approached for comment.

{"title": "Factory photographer and Lou Reed's 'worst' person: the legacy of Nat Finkelstein", "time": "Tue 16 Apr 2019 ", "category": null, "tags": "Culture,Photography,Andy Warhol,Bob Dylan,features", "content": "ho are the worst three people in the world? Back in the mid-to-late-1960s, you had quite a few to choose from. However, when  picked his trio there was, really, only one name on the list. “The three worst people in the world,” said Reed back in 1967, “are Nat Finkelstein and two speed dealers.”Reed’s frustration with a poor amphetamine supply is understandable. His dislike for one of the most dedicated and talented photographers to shoot the  in their prime, as well as Warhol and many other Factory luminaries, needs more unpacking.“It was a good insult,” says Elizabeth Finkelstein, the photographer’s widow, who has helped oversee In and Out of Warhol’s Orbit: Photographs by Nat Finkelstein, a new show of his work, opening at Proud Central in London this month. “Nat described the Velvet Underground as ‘the psychopath’s ’. He didn’t mean that as an insult. Lou responded. I think Nat wasn’t offended.”In fact, some credit Finkelstein’s rough Brooklyn manner – as well as his connections at world-class photo agencies, shooting for Life, among other titles – as the very qualities that allowed him to stroll into Warhol’s studio one day in 1964, more or less unannounced, and stay until 1967, chronicling Andy and co in exquisite detail.“There were three photographers that captured what is now known as the Silver Factory,” says Joseph Freeman, who served as Andy Warhol’s assistant from 1965 until 1967. “Billy Linich, later known as Billy Name; Stephen Shore; and there was Nat Finkelstein.”Today, Name is a bona-fide Warhol Superstar, and synonymous with those fertile years when Andy produced his Marilyn and Elvis screenprints in the silver-walled studio on East 47th Street that welcomed the Velvet Underground and Nico through the doors. Shore, meanwhile, is an acclaimed fine-art photographer, and the subject of a 2017 Museum of Modern Art retrospective in New York. Yet Finkelstein “seems to have got lost in the shuffle”, says Freeman; in the years leading up to his death in 2009, Nat’s profile was fairly modest and his archive was in disarray.This unevenness of legacies is all the more unjustified when you look at the pictures. “I think Warhol may have thought that Nat’s pictures were the best, but he didn’t really get along,” says Freeman. “Stephen Shore was very wealthy, and he looked at me as just like a nothing,” he goes on. “Billy was very friendly, but Andy gave Billy a camera, and told him to photograph what was going on around here. Nat was a yeoman; he was there every day just photographing.”One of Finkelstein’s key subjects were the Velvet Underground, a band who he grew almost too close to, says Elizabeth. “As individuals he loved them,” she explains. “He felt very connected to them, as his friends. He was a little older than the band [Finkelstein was born in 1933; Cale and Reed were both born in ’42], and I think that he also felt left out, later.”The band’s guitarist, Sterling Morrison, was especially close. “Sterling was a historian, who went on to earn a PhD in medieval literature,” says Elizabeth. “He was somebody who Nat could talk to. He loved people who were funny and smart.”The photographer also had a soft spot for , the socialite and Factory superstar who fatally overdosed in 1971 at the age 28. “He was very fond of her,” Elizabeth says. “There’s a certain tenderness in the photos of Edie.”Finkelstein’s relationship with Warhol seems cooler. Elizabeth is much younger than her late husband, whom she met in the early 2000s, but she believes Andy let the photographer into his studio because Finkelstein could get Warhol good press coverage. However, Finkelstein was at odds politically with Warhol’s conservatism. “He was very taken with the glamour at the Factory,” she says, “but he had a conflict within himself with how disengaged it was with what else was going on in the United States.”Finkelstein’s machismo, while serving him well in the early days, may have also led to his estrangement from pop art’s high table. “The Factory was predominantly gay and Nat was sort of macho,” says Freeman. “I think that he was a presence that they tolerated because his pictures were so good.” Elizabeth agrees. “He felt left out from the history,” she says. “You had so many incredible cultural landmarks coming out of that time. There were many cooks in the kitchen.”Finkelstein was in favour when the Factory hands were preparing any early pop-up book, Andy Warhol’s Index, recalls Freeman, “but then they tried to cut him out.” Half a century later, this move could be considered one of Warhol’s very few aesthetic missteps. As Freeman says: “I think Nat’s pictures are right up there.”"},

It showed that the sector added £10.8bn to the economy at the last count in 2016, £390m more than the previous year, more than the agricultural sector and roughly equal to cities such as Liverpool and SheffieldAt the same time the report revealed that 74% of arts organisations had been affected by public funding cuts.Serota praised the resilience and commitment of theatres, galleries and other arts organisations that continue to thrive despite receiving less public money. He said the success in the face of adversity “tells you about the brilliance of the people running these organisations, frankly.“It tells you about their commitment and determination in spite of the cuts. It also tells you if they had a bit more money they would do something rather wonderful with it.”One of the biggest challenges facing arts organisations are local authority cuts, with libraries, museums and the arts .In February, Birmingham city council , a significant cut but a step back from  of cutting twice that figure.“Local authorities will say they have no choice,” said Serota. “But there are choices being made and some local authorities are resisting those kinds of cuts more successfully than others.”He praised the energy and creativity of arts organisations in reaching new audiences and finding new money, but warned: “There comes a point when you cannot live without some form of investment and both local authorities and national government need to find ways of making that investment.“The prime minister declared that austerity was over: austerity is certainly not over yet for the arts and I hope that we’ll see some change.”The report, commissioned from the , states that 37% of arts organisations have become more risk averse as a result of funding cuts.Among organisations with funding cuts, 54% indicated they were unable to compensate for the loss.Many organisations are having to reduce staff or freeze wages. The report quotes the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, which said cuts to culture budgets were having an adverse effect on staffing levels at regional venues with some “suffering a lack of expertise and knowledge of orchestral music”.The report concludes that the arts and culture sector contributes £2.8bn to the Treasury via taxation, and that the sector’s total contribution to GDP, including employment and supply chains as well as the £10.8bn direct impact, amounted to about £23bn.Serota said it illustrated how important a subsidised arts sector was in feeding in the commercial sector and how public investment in arts and culture “repays itself over and over again.“It shows a very steady increase in the place of arts and culture in the economy as a whole. It is growing and it is growing much faster than the rest of the economy.”"},
{"title": "If firms were really taking on more people as a result of Brexit jitters, there’d be more part-timers", "time": "Tue 16 Apr 2019 ", "category": "Economics", "tags": "UK unemployment and employment statistics,Economics,Office for National Statistics,Work & careers,Unemployment and employment statistics,comment", "content": "here is a straightforward explanation for the continued . Firms are reluctant to invest because acute Brexit uncertainty means it is almost impossible to forecast future demand. Rather than be left with a bit of unwanted and expensive kit on their hands, businesses have taken on more workers instead.That all seems to make perfect sense. Britain has a reputation for having a flexible labour market, so companies can easily take on staff to meet temporary surges in demand knowing that they can get shot of them later.The only problem is that the theory doesn’t really square with the facts. If firms were really taking on more staff as a result of Brexit jitters, there would be an increase in part-time work and self-employment.But the latest  shows that in the year to February, there was a 473,000 increase in the number of people working full-time and a 15,000 drop in the number working part-time. There was a 100,000 increase in the number of full-time, self-employed workers but a drop of 24,000 in part-time, self-employed staff.Nor is there much evidence of a big switch to the hiring of temporary workers in the three months to February – a period when Brexit uncertainty was ratcheting up. The 179,000 increase in employment was split 138,000 full-time and 41,000 part-time. Self-employment was down by 23,000.As the employment expert  has noted, the tendency for the UK economy to become more labour intensive predates Brexit and helps explain the UK’s dismal productivity record since the financial crisis. Indeed, Theresa May is not the first prime minister to be faced with the challenge of overcoming the aversion of British companies to invest. Harold Wilson and Ted Heath both grappled with exactly the same problem in the 1960s and 70s.For decades, the critique has remained the same: a big productivity gap with rival countries is the result of low pay, inadequate training, clapped out machinery and an endemic short-termism. High levels of employment are the flipside of that.Warren Buffett is one of the world’s richest men. His wealth is estimated to be somewhere in excess of $80bn. Even so, according to accounts filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the company he runs – Berkshire Hathaway – is the epitome of fairness because Buffett earns just seven times the salary of the median employee.The reason, of course, is that Buffett’s net worth has nothing to do with his salary, which has remained unchanged at $100,000 a year for more than a quarter of a century. Rather, it comes from the rising value of his investments.All of which illustrates the dangers of reading too much into the specific details of the reports now being lodged with the SEC. Even so, the exercise is important for three reasons.First, transparency about pay gaps is a good thing. For too long, chief executives have brushed aside demands for them to come clean with bromides about the competition for talent and the need to disavow the politics of envy.Second, the first set of annual reports will act as a benchmark against which to judge what happens to the pay of executives and average workers in coming years.Finally, it will inform an already lively political debate about fairness and economic performance. Previous research has shown that the CEOs of the top 350 American companies earned  the wages of the average worker in 2017, compared with a ratio of 20 to 1 in the mid 1960s. Yet the US economy grows more slowly than it did in the 1960s, investment rates are lower than they were back then and the rapid improvements in living standards for the average US worker are a thing of the past. Those workers are now asking some pointed questions – and rightly so."},

In a dramatic turnaround, the court of appeal has ordered the tribunal to reconsider what has become the biggest class action in British legal history.Merricks said he was confident the tribunal will certify the action, enabling it to go to court and result in a multibillion-pound payout, if successful.“I am very pleased with today’s decision,” said Merricks. “It is nearly 12 years since Mastercard was clearly told that they had broken the law by imposing excessive card transaction charges, damaging consumers over a prolonged period.“When challenged, all they have done is to raise technical legal arguments that turn out to have no merit – as the court of appeal has shown today. It’s now time for Mastercard to admit the damage they did, to apologise to the British public, and to agree to pay the compensation they owe.”Mastercard said it will fight the case all the way to the supreme court, if necessary. It said in a statement: “This decision is not a final ruling and the proposed claim is not approved to move forward, rather the court has simply said a re-hearing on certain issues should happen.“Mastercard continues to disagree fundamentally with the basis of the claim and we believe UK consumers receive real value from the security, convenience and consumer protection of our payment services.”The tribunal originally rejected Merricks’s claim partly because it could not find clear evidence about how the Mastercard fees had been passed on to consumers – or absorbed by retailers – and how individual losses could be calculated. But the court of appeal found that was not a basis for rejecting certification for a court action.Merricks said the maximum payout would be about £300 for anyone who can prove they were in the UK in the 16 years between 1992 and 2008.In total, Merricks said 46 million adults could qualify and they need never have held a Mastercard. His case rests on the fact that higher prices would have been paid by all consumers during the period.The case is the first major test of a regime introduced under the Consumer Rights Act for people to recover losses from competition law infringements.Under the regime, UK-based members of a defined group are automatically bound into legal action unless they opt out, with the Competition Appeal Tribunal nominated to oversee such class action lawsuits.Lawyers acting for Merricks hailed the ruling as a landmark judgment. Boris Bronfentrinker of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart and Sullivan said: “The court of appeal’s judgment marks a significant day for the collective action regime in this country, after a number of false starts before the Competition Appeal Tribunal.”The case also represents a potential bonanza for new-style litigation funds that pay for class actions to be mounted.Merricks’s action was initially financed by Chicago-based litigation funder , which the Law Society Gazette said would make whatever was the greater of £135m or 30% of the proceeds of the case up to £1bn, plus 20% of the proceeds over £1bn.A new funder, Innsworth Litigation Funding, has taken on the case. It is understood it will receive a share of whatever is left if not every person in the class action lawsuit makes a claim.Merricks said he does not personally stand to make a cut from any court award. “I am paid an hourly rate of £150 for the time I have spent on this,” he said.

To illustrate “how badly they failed to do that”, Oliver pointed to the town of Kermit, West Virginia, where in two years, McKesson shipped five million pain pills to a town of 400 people.As a result, in 2008, the Drug Enforcement Agency fined McKesson $13m and ordered them to install their own controlled substances monitoring program. But the program “emphatically did not work” and McKesson continued escalating its distribution to what one DEA told the Washington Post was “a level of egregiousness not seen before”.Oliver was not surprised. “Of course they did – you can’t put McKesson in charge of monitoring McKesson. If the bears in your zoo get out at night and start mauling the other animals, you don’t deputize one of the bears to monitor the situation.”This illustrates what Oliver called the big problem with opioid distributors: “For companies involved in the opioid crisis, fines just became the cost of doing business. And throughout this crisis, it has been difficult to find any real accountability for the people involved.”The most frustrating example of this, Oliver said, is Purdue Pharma, the massive company behind highly addictive OxyContin. Purdue Pharma is owned by the Sacklers, a family worth around $13bn who “love putting their name on things,” said Oliver in reference to their many art museum donations, “although until very recently, they’ve been miraculously good at keeping their name off the opioid crisis”.That is changing, though, as court cases and public interest reveal the depth of the Sacklers’ involvement in pushing OxyContin on doctors and patients. Oliver focused on Richard Sackler, the son of the company’s founder and its president from 1999-2003 – the pivotal early years of exploding opioid use – who was quoted at a company event that the launch of OxyContin would trigger a “blizzard of prescriptions that will bury the competition”.Richard Sackler also, according to court documents, encouraged the company to publicly blame opioid addicts for abusing prescription medications. “He’s furious at the people who are part of the problem, but the people he’s angry at helped make him incredibly rich,” Oliver fumed. “You don’t see Adam Levine releasing a song condemning horny middle-aged women, because that would be hypocritical.”Oliver acknowledged that the Sackler family has vociferously denied exacerbating the opioid crisis, and have claimed that Richard’s quotes were taken out of context. About that context, though – “first, whenever they’ve added context, it hasn’t really helped them much,” Oliver said. And more importantly, “for a family that complains about a lack of context, they have fought tirelessly to withhold it – time and time again, they’ve settled cases on the condition that evidence will be sealed and unavailable to the public.”For example, a few years ago, the Sacklers settled a case with the state of Kentucky on the condition that the state attorney general destroy 17m pages of documents. “That’s an actual blizzard of context that they did not want anyone to see,” Oliver noted.A couple of weeks ago, the transcript of a video deposition Richard Sackler gave in that Kentucky case was leaked to ProPublica and Stat News. Some of the comments in it are damning, Oliver said, though it’s far less emotionally effective to read than to see video footage of the deposition. Purdue, however, is “fighting ferociously hard to keep it under seal” – true to form, as Oliver pointed out, given Richard Sackler’s long history of remaining frustratingly invisible despite having fingerprints all over one of the biggest public health crises of the 21st century.But Oliver had a counterstroke: they’re HBO, and can hire actors to play scenes from Sackler’s deposition, including callous disregard for questioning (Michael Keaton), lack of interest in the crisis (Bryan Cranston), commitment to OxyContin’s success (The Wire’s Michael K Williams) and over 100 “I don’t knows” (Richard Kind).Last Week Tonight has uploaded clips of each actor portraying Sackler during the deposition, as well as various state lawsuits against the family, to , “which I’m sure they’ll enjoy – they love having their name on fucking galleries,” Oliver joked.The point, Oliver concluded, is that “Richard Sackler’s deposition should not be something that Purdue gets to bury like it’s buried so many other things over the years … If Richard Sackler wanted context then guess what! This is it. It is a blizzard of context.”"},

I welcome any increase in basic hourly pay – but this must not be used to disguise a significant pay cut for 3,000 of your most longstanding staff.”The proposed changes would reduce night shifts to five hours, from 12am to 5am, she said.The new contracts would increase the basic rate of pay from £8.21 per hour for all retail employees, and would still include the benefits of an annual bonus, colleague discount, sharesave scheme and pension. However, staff will be asked to work more flexible times such as on bank holidays, while breaks would no longer be paid.McDonagh raised concerns over this flexibility and said while some might welcome the change, others would find it extremely difficult.Responding to the original letter, Burnley said: “As our customers change the way they shop, we need to ensure that we have the flexibility to change with them in order to remain competitive.“Although 50,000 of our colleagues are already on this contract, in the interests of fairness and to achieve the necessary level of flexibility we need all of our colleagues to be on the same terms.

But what is individual responsibility when confronted with the crisis of a rapidly changing planet?", "time": "Mon 15 Apr 2019 ", "category": "Climate change", "tags": "Environmental activism,Activism,Protest,Extinction Rebellion,features", "content": "n a recent Saturday in Brooklyn, against the unlikely backdrop of a huge blue-and-white Ikea outlet, several dozen volunteers hand-churned compost. Decomposing food scraps emit considerable heat, and the 6ft-tall compost heaps were warm to the touch. As shovels and pitchforks pierced the compost, gusts of steam rolled off like fog.A three-acre lot-turned-urban farm, the  contains the largest compost site in America powered entirely by sustainable sources. During an orientation for new volunteers, one of the site managers explained that the operation was the brainchild of a lawyer-turned-environmentalist named David Buckel, who supervised it until . He designed the site’s processes so it would run like clockwork, even in his absence.A woman asked, hesitantly: “Is he the one who … self-immolated?”“Yes,” the manager said.He didn’t elaborate but said he considered the site Buckel’s legacy, and that he and the other two managers felt honored to carry on its work.As the manager talked, a small wind turbine whizzed overhead. Energy from the turbine, plus several solar panels, fed into a generator that pumped air into the compost heaps not being churned by hand. On the other side of the lot grew rows of spinach, kale, tomatoes and other crops, which the farm sells or donates to food pantries.Terry Kaelber, Buckel’s husband and companion of 34 years, often volunteers at the compost site. When I asked him about the site, he thought carefully, then said: “There is something very simple and pure in coming together, in giving up your time, to take people’s food scraps and do the work that will enable those scraps to be turned back, over time, into food.”The site was a microcosm, he said, of the kind of self-sustaining, harmonious society Buckel wanted to build – the kind “I think in some ways we all subconsciously long for”.“I only wish,” he said, “that David had stuck it out.” Buckel – a 60-year-old retired gay rights attorney – left his cozy, garden-surrounded Brooklyn house and walked to nearby Prospect Park. He made his way to a stretch of grass, where he emailed media outlets a statement decrying humanity’s passivity in the face of pollution and global warming.A few minutes later, he doused himself in gasoline and set himself on fire.“Most humans on the planet now breathe air made unhealthy by fossil fuels, and many die early deaths as a result,” his statement said. “[M]y early death by fossil fuel reflects what we are doing to ourselves.”With characteristic care, he also left a short note at the scene for emergency personnel. “I am David Buckel and I just killed myself by fire as a protest suicide,” he wrote. “I apologize to you for the mess.”None of Buckel’s family or friends were aware of his intent, and we will never know for certain whether pre-existing mental distress may have contributed to his decision to take his life. But his writing made it clear he viewed his death in political terms and hoped it would galvanize mass action.His statement referred to the Buddhist monks who have burned themselves to death to protest against the occupation of Tibet. As someone who came of age during the Vietnam war, he was also surely familiar with the , a Saigon monk who self-immolated to protest against South Vietnamese persecution of Buddhists. He may have also known of Norman Morrison, a Quaker who  in front of the Pentagon to protest against the Vietnam war.Around the same period, , a university student in Prague, self-immolated in an attempt to rally Czechoslovaks against Soviet occupation. Before he died of his burns, Palach said his target was less the Soviet regime itself than the fatalism and despair he feared had overcome his fellow citizens.Despite the risk of copycats, most people who have committed political self-immolation have indicated that they hoped to inspire mass mobilization, not further death.Sometimes mobilization does come: when , an impoverished fruit vendor in Tunisia, set himself on fire in 2011 to protest government corruption, it catalyzed a mass protest that toppled the country’s dictatorship and inspired similar movements across the Arab world.It is difficult to say why some incidents of self-immolation are perceived as mental health tragedies and others as considered political acts; why some became enduring political iconography and others are relegated to obscurity; and why some catalyze change and others don’t.Buckel had led a distinguished legal career, and worked on famous cases including the Nebraska hate crime that inspired the film ; for that reason, as well as the shocking circumstances of his death, his death received national news coverage. But in a reactive 24-hour news cycle, the story was rapidly buried by the ongoing drama of the Mueller investigation and airstrikes on Syria.The mass action Buckel had hoped for did not come. There was no Prague spring or Tunisian revolution for the planet. Writing in the New York Times less than a week later, the novelist Nathan Englander  why Buckel’s death received so little attention compared with the “AR-15-level attention that we give the very worst among us”, mass killers.The muted response was probably, in part, an understandable reluctance to glorify suicide. A  of Buckel in the Times, investigating what might have driven a seemingly healthy man to set himself on fire, acknowledged that the question was mostly impossible to answer.But perhaps there were even more fundamental, unresolvable questions making otherwise sympathetic people uneasy: was Buckel’s death an act of optimism, or surrender? And what  individual responsibility, when confronted by the seemingly insurmountable crisis of a rapidly changing planet? one of five children; his father was an agricultural consultant and his mother a florist. As a child he spent some time working on his relatives’ farm, but he was troubled by the slaughter of animals and later became a pescatarian.He met Kaelber while living in Rochester, and they later moved to New York, where they eventually settled near Prospect Park. They shared their home with a lesbian couple with whom they were co-raising a college-aged daughter.Buckel loved the natural world and had a lifelong commitment to environmental issues. His work as a lawyer, however, focused on poverty law and LGBT rights. He spent the bulk of his career at , an LGBT rights organization based in New York.In the 1990s, when Buckel joined Lambda, LGBT rights were on shaky and sometimes non-existent legal footing. Homosexuality was banned in the military; some states still enforced sodomy laws; and most LGBT rights organizations were focused on securing basic employment and housing protections for gay people and fighting HIV/Aids discrimination. Marriage was far, far away. The legal arm of the gay rights movement was a long-shot insurgency, and attorneys working on LGBT issues sometimes felt as if they were in a jurisprudential wild west.“At the time it felt like, ‘There is no law here, there is no opening for this – so we’re just going to make one,’” Beatrice Dohrn, a former Lambda colleague of Buckel’s, told me. “Once gay rights had more legal footing the landscape changed. But at the time we really were kind of outlaws.”It would be easy, and not totally incorrect, to describe Buckel – fastidious in his habits and devoted to his work – as a strait-laced but formidable lawyer who excelled at working within the system to change it. In one sense, Dohrn said, he was. But that image would obscure his anti-establishment streak. “That suit he always wore?” she said. “That wasn’t David. That was something he forced himself into.”“David was a funny person with a wry, and sharp, wit,” Suzanne Goldberg, another former Lambda colleague, told me. In a parody of the conventions of legal correspondence, he sometimes signed his documents “DB/afq” – “David Buckel/another fucking queer”.He never lost sight of the fact that we were representing real people, often with serious difficulties in their livesBut he was also “a careful and deeply committed lawyer”, Goldberg said – a “meticulous” person who brought intense sense of purpose to his work. “He never lost sight of the fact that we were representing real people, often with serious difficulties in their lives as a result of discrimination or harassment.”Although a private person, he radiated sincere interest in others. When you were in conversation with him, Dohrn said, you felt as if you were “the only person in the room”, so intense was his attention. He would ask question after question about your life and interests, listening carefully to the answers, then asking more. You could talk for ages, and only later realize that you never learned anything about him.At the time, advocating for LGBT rights meant navigating a legal framework in which anti-gay logics were “baked in”, Dohrn said. Lawyers and activists were sometimes forced to accept homophobic premises in order to achieve tactical wins. “A lot of lawyers would look for loopholes in the law, but we were like, ‘No, I don’t want to win that way.’”Buckel exemplified the second attitude. He believed in the righteousness of the cause, and seemed buoyed by faith in human nature. His refusal to compromise and his tendency to embrace uphill battles sometimes vexed his more pragmatic colleagues. Evan Wolfson, a former colleague, praised Buckel’s work but said he sometimes tended to “categorical” or “rigid” thinking. He could be “very black-and-white, very un-nuanced in his initial appraisals of things, and because he was also very methodical and very serious, we would have to kind of reel him back in, or open up a gradation, or try to persuade him to see a more flexible alternative”.His support for pursuing cases in conservative states – Utah, Iowa, Nebraska – considered poor soil for gay rights activism did, however, lead to several landmark victories. And he was also ahead of the curve in embracing issues – such as rights and protections for LGBT youth – regarded at the time as tangential or tactically risky.At the time, “the right wing was still very fixated on this idea that we – gay people – were trying to indoctrinate young people”, Dohrn said. To avoid encouraging that trope, gay groups tended to steer clear of issues involving youth. Buckel, however, urged Lambda to take more cases defending young people.They included  (1996), which determined that schools have a duty to protect students from bullying because of their sexuality; and (1999), which overturned the school district’s “unwritten policy” against gay-friendly student groups. He also worked on  (2000), an unsuccessful attempt to force the organization to end its then ban on gay members.He was also an early advocate for transgender rights, which Wolfson said he views as Buckel’s signature achievement at Lambda.In 1993, in Nebraska, two men raped Brandon Teena, a 21-year-old trans man. Teena reported the crime to the local sheriff’s department. The sheriff not only failed to take the allegation seriously, but tipped off the rapists, who murdered Teena and two witnesses.The events inspired a 1998 documentary, The Brandon Teena Story, and the 1999 film Boys Don’t Cry, for which Hilary Swank, portraying Teena, won an Academy award for best actress.With the support of Lambda and other organizations, Teena’s mother, JoAnn Brandon, sued the sheriff’s office and county government. In 2001, the Nebraska supreme court ruled that the sheriff had violated a duty to protect Teena.On the Teena case and others, Buckel’s talent for listening was crucial to earning clients’ trust, Dohrn said; his most powerful weapon was often his empathy. and he had “a revulsion for excess consumption”, Dohrn said. He brought his lunch to work every day in the blue plastic bag in which his morning paper was delivered. When he was looking for a home in Brooklyn, he was determined to find one near a park. He loved gardening and gave plants as gifts.When he retired from Lambda in 2008, it seemed like a good time to devote himself to the environment. While working on grant applications, he became interested in the Red Hook Community Farms. The lot had a small compost site that he believed was underused. With the aid of a grant from the sanitation department, he began expanding the operation into one that could process several tons of compost a week.He was determined to run the , now supported by the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and the city government, using only human power and sustainable electricity. At the time it was generally considered difficult, if not impossible, to run a large-scale composting operation without significant help from machines. He threw himself at the challenge of proving that thinking wrong, and succeeded.“David often said that if he hadn’t become a lawyer he would have become an engineer,” Kaelber said. “He loved puzzles. In this case the puzzle was how to create a community composting site that didn’t have rats and vermin, that didn’t smell, that didn’t have the negative things people associate with composting. He believed it could be done.”Domingo Morales, now one of the site’s managers, considers Buckel his mentor. “He was the most intelligent person I’ve ever known,” he said. His meticulousness was key to the site’s sustainability and scalability. “Whenever David sent an email to someone it was always a page long. He would answer all these questions that you have.”Buckel was always upbeat when talking to volunteers, but privately he expressed more doubt. “He was realistic, in the sense that he knew we were barely scratching the surface,” Morales said.“There were times we would get into these discussions on the environment,” Morales said, “and they would get very dark. I got the sense from David that he didn’t really blame other people, but that he kind of considered himself to blame. Any environmental injustice, anything going wrong with the world – he didn’t just get mad at other people, he was mad at himself.”He walked a mile to work every day, to avoid using fossil fuels. He was painstakingly frugal in his habits. He tinkered with the compost processes for ever-greater efficiency. He seemed almost embarrassed of his own life on earth – the space he occupied; the resources he expended – and constantly sought new ways to offset what he viewed as his cost. But it never felt like enough.“I think some of David’s distress was just all that was going on,” Kaelber said. “The gutting of the [Environmental Protection Agency] since the election of Trump; the complete denial of climate change and the science behind it; the fact that they want to open more and more land to oil and gas drilling, instead of focusing on sustainable solutions.”During a conversation about two years before he died, Buckel asked Morales what he thought of the self-immolating Tibetan monks. They argued about the ethics of killing oneself as protest. Morales felt it was a foolish method of protest, especially if someone is a parent or spouse with obligations to living people, but Buckel felt it was an honorable act, maybe the most honorable act one can do.None of his friends or family noticed anything unusual in the days leading up to his death, but Kaelber said he was upset by news that Scott Pruitt, then head of the EPA, was rolling back numerous environmental regulations.Saturday 14 April was a mild day, good weather for composting, and nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Early in the morning, Morales remembers, “he texted me: ‘Hey, Domingo, I’m going to be out sick today.’ The past couple months he had been training me to run the site without him, but I thought nothing of it. So I said: ‘OK, cool, hope you’re all right, feel better.’ Then a few minutes later he emailed me the letter he sent the news outlets, with an additional note at the top to me. He apologized for leaving the way he did, and leaving me with this responsibility. He told me he was proud of me, personally and successfully, and he ended with a little joke, saying I should hire some temps. He was basically saying ‘the site must go on.’” wrestle with how to talk about his death. At his memorial service, one of the women with whom he and Kaelber were co-raising their daughter articulated the dilemma: they didn’t want to ignore the deep personal desperation they believe influenced his decision, but they also didn’t want to detract from his dedication to causes that meant a lot to him.His statement explaining his death is not a tightly argued, lawyerly brief, peppered with dire statistics about global warming; although it mentions pollution, the actual words “climate change” or “global warming” do not appear. The letter often feels more like a statement of frustration with human nature than about climate change, and reading it buttresses the sense, expressed by some who knew him, that he might have been using his political anxieties to rationalize a decision he had already made.“[My] privilege,” he wrote, is “feeling heavier than responsibility met.”But his concerns about the planet are clear; and, whether or not one agrees with the decision, so was his explanation for his self-immolation.“You know, it was a very conscious, deliberate choice he made,” Kaelber told me. “Not that I was aware of it beforehand. But he never did anything that wasn’t deliberate.”Dohrn, his former colleague, said: “I don’t think we can treat his death like it was a valiant, valid decision unaffected by things that hopefully people will get care for.” But “if his death is going to garner attention outside the immediate circle of people who are grieving – if it is going to have a public component – then I think that public component should reflect the issue he connected his death to”.During her , Buckel’s niece, Carrie Bryant, said: “David, I promise you –  promise you – that we will give voice to those who have been silenced; we will give love to those who need it; we will tend to this, our beloved great Earth; and we will honor you,” through “simple, individual acts, as you so courageously did to make this world a more loving and just place”.She added: “This much we owe to you.” immediate action. It didn’t. By apparent coincidence, however, the anniversary of his death, however, will overlap with what could be the largest-ever direct action over climate change. , an international activist group, is planning a global wave of civil disobedience the week of 14 April.Extinction Rebellion, and similar groups such as the , believe mass civil disobedience is the most effective way to break through passivity and pressure governments to take concrete action on the climate.As a dry run of sorts, members of Extinction Rebellion were recently arrested in New York for  Fifth Avenue. In London, members  partly naked in parliament. Eve Mosher, a spokewoman, told me that the group hopes for hundreds of headline-grabbing arrests this month. The climate movement may be gaining momentum after all, even if Buckel didn’t live to see it. Yesterday, at the site where he died, Extinction Rebellion held a “funeral” for the species that have gone extinct because of climate change.He understood that humans are deeply flawed. I think what drove him was how to inspire people to be their best selvesFrom everything we understand, climate change is a tragedy of the commons on a vast scale. Addressing it will require human beings do a lot of things they aren’t naturally inclined to do, like make short-term sacrifices for the sake of long-term common good: the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)  that as early as 2030 the earth may warm 1.5C (2.7F) over pre-industrial levels – and that 1.5C is the highest level the planet can sustain without entering the realm of the catastrophic. Just limiting warming to that level will require, the IPCC said, mobilization of a scale with “no documented historic precedent”.It’s a sobering thought, and it invites the kind of fatalism that Buckel hoped to fight against.“I don’t think you can say he was either ‘pessimistic’ or ‘optimistic’” about human nature, Kaelber said. “He was more complicated than that. He understood that humans are deeply flawed. I think what drove him was how to inspire people to be their best selves.”He added: “If people want to honor David’s life they should look at how they can get involved, politically and in their own personal lives, in combating climate change.” His voice cracked with emotion. “In the thing that David wrote, the most meaningful part, to me, was: in the aggregated acts of millions of individuals,  is how change is going to occur.” tree saplings. Perhaps in 10 years, Kaelber told me, he will go visit them all and see what they have become.Buckel’s friends and family are also building a grove of trees on the space where he died. They have planted some dogwoods, staggered to bloom at different times. Kaelber hopes it will become a gathering place for contemplation, but also a place where people might hold community meetings to organize against global warming.“He always loved trees,” Kaelber said. He hopes the site will become known as David’s Grove.Beatrice Dohrn also told me a story about Buckel’s love of plants. “You know, in 1997 I had a breakup that I grieved very hard, and David, as if to cheer me up, gave me a jade plant. I’ve kept it for many, many years, and at some point it almost died,” she said.“It was down to a stump. But for some reason I didn’t give up on it.” "},

But this year, not a single leatherback came to Chacocente, and conservation groups in Costa Rica and Mexico, have recorded in sightings of the huge turtles.“This is the first time it’s happened and the chances are that it will happen again,” said Alison Gunn, the Americas and Caribbean program manager for , which tags all female leatherbacks that nest in Chacocente. “I do view it as an indicator that we should really sit up and take notice of.”The largest of all sea turtles, leatherbacks can weigh up to 1,500lb (680kg) and reach over 6ft (2 meters) in length, placing them among the largest reptiles in the world.But despite their enormous size, leatherback populations face threats from human activity, and the eastern Pacific population of leatherbacks is classified as critically endangered.Both legal and illegal fishing have helped drive the decline, as well as egg poaching. In Central America sea turtle eggs are considered a delicacy and in some communities are held to be an aphrodisiac.In 2018, Velkis Gadea, director of Flora & Fauna International’s turtle conservation programme in Nicaragua,  whereas in the past 30 to 40 leatherbacks would nest in a season, that number had more recently dropped to five to 10.FFI estimates that its education and conservation programs now protect 90% of Nicaragua’s leatherback nests, but that it has not been enough to undo historical damage.“The reports that we have from the elders in the community say that back in the 80s, prior to a boom in poaching, there were turtles nesting in the hundreds at [Chacocente] ,and now there is a very discrete number of leatherbacks there,” she said. “We know that whilst we are doing all that we can to increase the recruitment of hatchling sea turtles there are still other factors.”While conservation efforts have focused on countering human harvesting of turtles, there is also growing evidence that warming temperatures could play a role in the population decline.In leatherbacks and other species of sea turtles, the sex of a turtle hatchling is determined by the temperature of the sand where the egg incubated. Higher temperatures produce female eggs, and scientists suspect that a large portion of sea turtle hatchlings are now female. in the eastern Pacific found that leatherback sea turtle nests were 79% female.  in Australia found female turtles outnumbering males by as much as 116 to 1.Because male turtles breed more often than females, this gender imbalance may not yet be extreme enough to affect sea turtle populations, but biologists warn that if temperatures continue to rise and push the sex ratio closer to 100% female, it could devastate turtle populations.“It is heartbreaking to think that all of the conservation efforts could be in vain if we do not address the human-made threats to turtles once they reach the sea,” Gunn said. “Sea turtles have been around since the time of the dinosaurs – we must not let them die out on our watch.”"},

A spokesperson for  said there were several hundred people still occupying the bridge, adding that “morale was high” and a cheer went up every time someone was taken away by the police.The arrests came after the Metropolitan police issued an order under section 14 of the Public Order Act, which allows conditions to be imposed on “public processions” and “public assemblies”. The order restricted the protesters to the area around Marble Arch. A police officer on the bridge said that the Met could impose limits on assembly if they felt there was a serious risk of disruption or to public order. “Obviously, sitting down on Waterloo Bridge is a serious disruption to the community,” he said.Police mingled more or less freely with the crowd and around several gazebos, potted plants and trees, and a mobile stage that was hosting a choir. “They are taking people incredibly slowly,” said one protest organiser. “It could take all night.”At about 10pm police became anxious when several dozen more people arrived to reinforce the numbers on the bridge. By midnight there had been around 50 arrests linked to the climate protests. Earlier , one of the movement’s leaders, said nothing like this had been seen on the streets of London for decades. “What’s amazing about this is for 30 years you have just had that closing up of public space – ‘you can’t do this, you can’t do that, you’ve got to finish then’.Extinction Rebellion is an international protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Demonstration have included  and . The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who 'have failed us', to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency.“Suddenly what Extinction Rebellion has done is actually say: ‘we are doing this.’ And the state is so weak through austerity that they can’t stop us.”The campaign cites the civil rights and suffragette movements as inspiration and is backed by hundreds of scientists and academics, including the former archbishop of Canterbury .Williams, who part in Monday’s protest, said at a meditation the night before that humans had declared war on nature: “We are here tonight to declare that we do not wish to be at war. We wish to make peace with ourselves by making peace with our neighbour Earth and with our God,” he said.The group wrote to the prime minister, Theresa May, on Monday outlining their demands and asking for talks. In the letter they warned they would escalate their disruptive actions over the coming days and weeks unless the government acts.“Make no mistake, people are already dying,” the letter said. “In the majority world, indigenous communities are now on the brink of extinction. This crisis is only going to get worse … prime minister, you cannot ignore this crisis any longer. We must act now.”At Waterloo Bridge before the arrests, protesters blocked the roads and turned the crossing into an impromptu , with people bringing trees, flowers and setting up a miniature skate park and stage.At Oxford Circus thousands of protesters danced to live music at the normally busy junction. A lifesized model of a boat was parked in the middle of the crossing with the slogan Tell the Truth emblazoned on the side. At nearby Piccadilly Circus the youth section of  held a sit-down protest, writing messages in chalk on the pavement.Organisers hope the rebellion will last for several days and say its success depends on the number of people willing to occupy the sites in the days and nights ahead.Laura Sorensen, a retired teacher who travelled from Somerset to join the protests, was one of thousands who gathered on Waterloo Bridge in the sunshine.She said: “I am so worried about what’s happening to the planet. We are on a knife-edge now and I felt strongly that I needed to get out and show myself, rather than just talk about it in the pub.”Sorensen said she had not previously been active in the environment movement but that as a child she had been given a love of nature by her parents. “I see this disaster unfolding all around me … it is terrifying and the government have done nothing despite all the warnings, so we have to act now.”Trey Taylor, 19, was with two friends in Piccadilly Circus. He said he felt compelled to act when he realised the scale of the emergency.“We are facing environmental breakdown and nothing remotely proportionate is being done about it … when you look at the facts this is happening now and the government response is utterly woeful.”In Parliament Square about 2,000 people gathered under a sea of flags, placards and banners. From an octagonal stage erected on the green for speakers, Jamie Kelsey Fry, the contributing editor for New Internationalist magazine, said: “This is not a political movement, this is a movement of humanity. We are all backgrounds, all ages, all races, bound together in one wish, one dream, which is that we will have a good, decent, loving future, for generations to come.”Five protesters were arrested for suspected criminal damage when they staged a demonstration at Shell’s headquarters. A glass revolving door was shattered and hundreds of passersby watched as two activists climbed above the entrance, writing “Shell knew” and “Shell knows” on the building.At Marble Arch hundreds of people sat in the sun, listening to bands playing from an open-sided truck.Simon Bramwell, who was glued to a revolving door at , said: \"Shell has known about the impact the fossil fuel industry is having on our planet for decades. They've done nothing but deceive, lie and undermine any efforts at transition to renewables.\"  Police walked among protesters, many of whom had come with their children, while groups of activists at the periphery blocked the various roads feeding into what is usually one of London’s busiest junctions.Alex Armitage, an NHS doctor, had been drafted in as a spokesperson for the Marble Arch group. He said he hoped the police could be brought on side. “Eventually if this is going to work, if we are going to have the massive change in the economy that we need to protect ourselves from climate change, we are going to need the police to be unwilling or unable to restore order, and then the government has no option but to negotiate,” he said. “It all seems really grandiose – but so is the scale of the problem facing us.”A number of major roads in the capital were brought to a standstill with roads gridlocked in surrounding streets. The AA said the disruption had been significant.Police on Waterloo Bridge said there were no plans to move protesters on for the time being. One officer said: “It’s been very peaceful so far. Everyone has been really pleasant. The only grief we’ve had is from passing motorists shouting at them to ‘get a job’ – that’s about as exciting as it’s got.”The events in London were the biggest demonstrations but there were smaller protests in other cities around the world."},

Researchers are now finding microplastics everywhere they look; in rivers, the  and  around the world.Other recent studies have found microplastics in , China, in the , a Unesco world heritage site, and in . Humans and other animals are known to consume the tiny plastic particles via food and water, but the potential health effects on people and ecosystems are as yet unknown.However the ubiquity of the pollution means it needs to be taken very seriously, said Steve Allen, at the  near Toulouse and who led the new work in the Pyrenees: “If it is going to be a problem, it is going to be a very big problem. I don’t think there is an organism on Earth that is immune to this.”About 335m tonnes of plastic is produced each year – while it degrades extremely slowly, it can be broken into smaller and smaller pieces. Microplastic pollution in  is now well known but just two previous studies have looked at its presence in the air, one in , and another in . Both found a steady fall of particles.The new study, , is the first to show microplastic is raining down just as hard in remote environments and that it can travel across significant distances through wind. The team collected samples from high altitudes in the Pyrenees that were far from sources of plastic waste – the nearest village was 6km away, the nearest town 25km, and the nearest city 120km.They found an average of 365 plastic particles, fibres and films were deposited per square metre every day. “It’s astounding and worrying that so many particles were found,” said Allen.“It is comparable to what was found in the centre of Paris and Dongguan, and those are megacities where a lot of pollution is expected,” said Deonie Allen, also at EcoLab and part of the team. “Because we were on the top of a remote mountain, and there is no close source, there is the potential for microplastic to be anywhere and everywhere.”The level of plastic particle rain correlated with the strength of the winds and analysis of the available data showed the microplastics could be carried 100km in the air. However, modelling indicates they could be carried much further.  is already known to be carried thousands of kilometres by wind.The most common microplastics found were polystyrene and polyethylene, both widely used in single-use packaging and plastic bags. The samples were collected during winter and it is possible that even more microplastic may fall in summer, when drier weather means particles are more easily lifted from the ground by the wind.Microplastics have been shown to    when mistaken for food and were found inside  in a recent UK survey. They were revealed in 2017 to have contaminated  and in October to have been  in Europe, Japan and Russia.Many scientists are concerned about the , which easily absorb toxic chemicals and can host , with some even suggesting . The new research shows microplastics can remain airborne.“When you get down to respiratory size particles, we don’t know what those do,” said Deonie Allen. “That is a really big unknown, and we don’t want it to end up something like asbestos.” Plastic fibres have been found in human lung tissue, with those researchers suggesting they are “”.Professor Stefan Krause, at the University of Birmingham, UK, and not part of the team, said the new Pyrenees research was convincing: “These findings surely highlight the need for more detailed studies.”“Frankly we are only at the start of understanding [microplastic pollution],” he said. Krause is leading a project called  which will produce the first systematic, global analysis of microplastics in freshwater ecosystems. He said the particles pose a range of potential dangers, from affecting soils and food production and carrying toxic chemicals and microbes far and wide."},
{"title": "'Body eruption': the aphids that sacrifice themselves for colony", "time": "Mon 15 Apr 2019 ", "category": "Wildlife", "tags": "Insects,Animals,Wildlife,news", "content": "While humans might change their locks to deal with intruders, a species of aphid opts for a communal sacrifice, releasing huge quantities of a sticky bodily fluid to plug holes in their nests.Researchers who studied the makeup of the fluid found the process for nest repair was similar to what happens when aphids are wounded, involving the release of substances that clot and form a scab. This means similar mechanisms underpin both individual immunity and so-called social immunity – when organisms work together to protect their communities from enemies and disease.“The mechanistic bases of social immunity, which are mainly behavioural, physiological and organisational ones, are expected to be distinct from the molecular and cellular immune mechanisms,” said Dr Takema Fukatsu, a co-author of the research from the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Japan. “In this context, our finding was quite unexpected and surprising.” When predators break into the growths, or galls, on winter hazel trees that house the aphid , “soldier nymphs” of the species gather to sting the invader and repair the damage. The breach is patched up with a white gunge, released by the soldier nymphs in what the team call a “body eruption”.“Dozens of soldiers come out, erupt, mix and plaster, and the gall breach is promptly sealed with the coagulated bodily fluid,” the authors write in the journal . The shrivelled aphids use their legs to mix the fluids.The soldier nymphs run the risk of being left outside or suffocated by their own goo, while even those that initially survive the body eruption are likely to die soon after. “It is unlikely that the tiny soldiers that have lost almost all body fluid can survive long,” said Fukatsu.In the latest study, the team has discovered that the bodily fluid contains a cocktail of chemicals and is particularly rich in lipids that are released from a type of insect immune cell that disintegrates within the fluid after the body eruption. This allows them to patch up the breach in a sort of “soft plug” that hardens and becomes black over time. Gradually plant tissue grows and covers the area, completely sealing it up.The results suggest the soldier nymphs have boosted levels of production of particular cells and substances involved in clotting and scab formation, meaning a mechanism initially developed for wound healing in individuals may have been adapted to become a key process in defending the entire colony.“We are not sure that the body fluid coagulation mechanisms in the soldier nymphs are exactly the same as that [for wound healing] in normal aphids, but suppose that the mechanisms are fundamentally the same,” said Fukatsu.“In most cases, the self-explosive behaviours to discharge the body fluid are for entangling and immobilising enemies. It is quite exceptional that such behaviours are utilised for nest [or] gall repairing. I don’t know other cases in the insect world.”"},

We will restore access as soon as we are able to do so.”Passengers were not informed about the decision to turn off the network, and many travellers wrongly attributed the disruption to conventional technical faults.Disabling public communications networks is an increasingly common tactic used in policing disruption across the world. Almost eight years ago, San Francisco’s Bart transit system turned off the mobile phone service across the network to prevent a similar campaign aimed at stopping trains in protest at the killing of a man by Bart police. That decision was criticised by the American Civil Liberties Union, which said it was reminiscent of censorship in the Middle East.Extinction Rebellion is an international protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Demonstration have included  and . The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who 'have failed us', to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency.The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said that while he shared the passion of the protesters about the urgent need to tackle climate change he was “extremely concerned” about plans to disrupt the underground.In a statement on Twitter, Khan said: “Targeting public transport in this way would only damage the cause of all of us who want to tackle climate change, as well as risking Londoners’ safety and I’d implore anyone considering doing so to think again.”At least 168 arrests were made on Tuesday, the Metropolitan police said, bringing the total of Extinction Rebellion-related detentions since Monday up to 290.Hundreds of Extinction Rebellion protesters were still dancing around a boat stage at Oxford Circus just after 10pm, as police tried – apparently in vain – to clear the area.The events in London were part of an international “climate rebellion” organised by . Organisers said demonstrations had taken place or were planned in 80 cities across 33 countries – from India to Australia, and around Europe and the US. In The Hague on Tuesday, activists occupied the international criminal court building. In Scotland, more than 1,000 protesters blockaded the North Bridge in , bringing one of the main routes into the city centre to a standstill. Police said they made 29 arrests.The blockade began at 3pm, when groups of people on bikes converged from both sides of the bridge, before a human chain formed across the road.At about 5.30pm, protesters crossed Princes Street and unfurled banners. Most were immediately carried off the road by police.The biggest protests have been in London, with thousands of parents and their children joining scientists, teachers and environmentalists to demand urgent action in the face of “possible human extinction”.Among the protesters was the prominent UN environment lawyer Farhana Yamin, who helped negotiate the Paris climate agreement. Just after 2pm, she glued her hands to the pavement outside Shell’s headquarters near the River Thames.Nearby, police moved on to Waterloo Bridge to begin a second wave of arrests as hundreds of protesters continued their blockade.Some of those on the bridge had been locked or glued to a lorry parked across the carriageway since Monday night.By about 5pm, the atmosphere at Waterloo Bridge had calmed after police stopped arresting people. On Tuesday evening, police turned their attention away from Waterloo Bridge to Oxford Circus. Officers circulated around the crowd in groups, informing people that if they stayed in that location they were at risk of arrest.The Guardian witnessed at least one person being carried away, while others left the crowd voluntarily after speaking to police. “We are peaceful, what about you?” protesters chanted as police made an arrest.Many protesters said they were willing to remain at the junction all night in order to hold the space.Harriet Gold, 26, a student from Bristol, was among them. “I feel really confident,” she said. “I was surprised to wake up to hear that they had Waterloo Bridge still.”Elmo MB, 20, was manning a wellbeing tent. He said he was not worried about the police order to leave the area. “I think breaking the law is the point,” he said.“There are lots of brave folk and a lot of people have been arrested so far, but they pull one person off and two people come back on. I’m not sure how long this will last, but I imagine it will last through the night.”Extinction Rebellion was formed in the UK last year and held its first civil disobedience protests in London in November. It is calling on the UK government to  to zero by 2025 and establish a citizens’ assembly to devise an emergency plan of action to tackle climate breakdown and biodiversity loss.On Tuesday, Supt Colin Wingrove of the Metropolitan police confirmed a section 14 order was in place and called on the protesters to leave Waterloo Bridge, Oxford Circus and Parliament Square but they could continue their demonstration at Marble Arch.“In order to impose this condition, the Met required evidence that serious disruption was being caused to communities in London. We so far have 55 bus routes closed and 500,000 people affected as a result … we are satisfied that this threshold has been met and this course of action is necessary.”"},

They warned that a “massive reallocation of capital” was necessary to prevent global warming above the 2°C maximum target set by the , with the banking system required to play a pivotal role.“If some companies and industries fail to adjust to this new world, they will fail to exist,” Carney and De Galhau said.Climate change poses significant risks to banks and insurers from rising instances of catastrophic weather-related events, such as heatwaves, droughts and floods, which could land them with significant losses.There are also risks for financial firms as governments accept the need to tackle climate change because banks that have lent to companies reliant on burning fossil fuels run the risk of steep financial losses.Carney has previously warned that , due to new vehicle emissions tests and changes in the tax system, which have had , are an example of this in action.Banks could find they have stranded assets that turn out to be worthless if they are reliant on burning fossil fuels. Threadneedle Street has said as much as $20tn (£15.3tn) of assets could be wiped out by climate change if it is not effectively addressed.The open letter from Carney and De Galhau accompanies the launch of a report from the  (NGFS), an international group of central banks and financial regulators, outlining the steps necessary for financiers to tackle climate change.Global warming has typically been of secondary concern to central bankers since the 2008 financial crisis, as they grappled with the immediate threat of banking failures. However, there is growing recognition that action is needed to fight the risks it poses.Although they have received praise for advancing the debate about climate change, Carney, central bankers and financiers have been  without tougher regulation being introduced.Frank van Lerven, a senior economist at the New Economics Foundation thinktank, said: “Central banks across the world, and in the UK, have done a very good job of identifying the problem. The question is whether they have the right balance between being thought leaders on this issue and identifying problems and taking action.”"},

No other jurisdiction in the world has these requirements.”The state industrial relations minister, Grace Grace, said the changes were made after concerns raised by the Electrical Trades Union and others about safety practices at solar construction sites, including the use of backpackers as labourers.The mounting of solar panels is manual labour and does not require any electrical wiring work, but the panels are live during the process.“Workers are at risk from electrocution … these are not jobs for unlicensed workers,” Grace said.Solar developers have told Guardian Australia they are unsure whether they can find enough licensed electricians to complete projects under construction.Lane Crockett, the head of renewable infrastructure for Impact Investment Group, the company building the Brigalow solar farm near Toowoomba, said the company had planned to hire 60 local labourers, who would be trained to install solar panels.Instead, it would now require fly-in fly-out electricians. Crockett said the company was worried it might not be able to find enough electricians willing to carry out the manual work.“We just don’t know at this point,” he said.Employers in regional Queensland often have , according to federal government labour force information. It says workers are often unwilling to relocate, and many employers cannot compete with salaries offered by the mining industry.Crockett said the new regulation was likely to affect future investment decisions.“It means that building solar farms in Queensland is more expensive, and it’s also got to mean there’s less investment, less renewables,” he said.The CEC’s analysis shows the change would add 1.5% to 4% to the construction cost of a typical solar farm. Margins are increasingly thin in the renewable energy sector.The Australian Energy Market Operator issues ratings called “marginal loss factors”, which score renewable projects based on local demand and effectively determine how much energy that project can feed into the grid.The first wave of large-scale solar projects in Queensland capitalised on the best sites, close to substations, where additional generation was most valuable. The challenge for subsequent projects is making them work in a market where there are no imminent plans to phase out baseload power generators.Freeman is calling on the government to delay implementation of the changes, to allow a longer consultation period to find a less problematic solution for the industry.“The Queensland government is yet to present us with a safety rationale about why this change is required or why consultation was so rushed and haphazard,” Freeman said.“The new rules effectively cut local communities out of a significant slice of the job opportunities created by new solar farm developments.“The work in question is not electrical work, it is mechanical work. There is no need for an electrician to do it, and the end result is that many locals will miss out on job opportunities for no reason.”In a statement last week, Grace said the change “achieves the right balance between our renewable energy target and ensuring worker and community safety”.The ETU’s Queensland state secretary, Peter Ong, said the CEC’s response was “overheated and hysterical” and the industry’s comments would do little to change the perception that “major players in the solar industry put profits before people”.“The renewables sector will continue to grow and it is important that as it grows it provides safe, reliable and sustainable power supplies to the people of Queensland.”On Tuesday Westpac announced that it would source all its energy from renewables by 2025, the . The bank said it would buy just over a quarter of the electricity generated by the 120-megawatt Bomen solar farm, to be built near Wagga Wagga in NSW, which would enable it to reach 45% of renewable energy use by 2021.Chief operating officer Gary Thursby said the move was “key to delivering on our existing climate change and sustainability commitments”.The tech firm Atlassian , while the Commonwealth Bank  that means it now sources 65% of its energy from renewables, with a target of 100% by 2030."},

Yet, a recent report by the Stockholm Resilience Centre shows that attempting to achieve the socioeconomic goals using conventional growth policies would make it virtually impossible to reduce the speed of global warming and environmental degradation.The research team tested three other scenarios, and the only one that met all goals implemented systemic transformational change. A key element was reducing inequality by a redistribution of wealth, work and income, including ensuring that the 10% richest people take no more that 40% of the income.We clearly have an unprecedented and immense challenge before us, with little choice but to engage as a mass movement to create a system-wide transformation in our politics and our economy.

The organisation I founded, the World Future Council, has identified the best policy solutions available in countries, regions and cities worldwide. British Columbia has a carbon tax. Maryland, US, has obligatory environmental literacy education. Rwanda has a successful reforestation policy. Japan has an effective energy conservation law. Costa Rica has an exemplary biodiversity law.These provide starting points. But the UK has gone in the opposite way: 10 years ago the WFC helped MPs introduce feed-in tariff legislation (originating in Germany) to speed up the production of renewable energy. But the coalition government hastened to emasculate it. As many proposals are rejected over cost, a key recommendation is the adaptation of quantitative easing to fund the energy transition.One WFC proposal is for central banks to buy fossil fuel “stranded assets” on condition the money paid is invested in renewables. How this can be done sustainably is explained in our study “Unlocking the trillions”. As central banks cannot go bankrupt in their own currency, they can also buy – and add to their reserves – long-term and low- or zero-interest bonds to kickstart the required emergency reforms in poor countries. Larry Elliott is informative on a subject that matters, as usual (, 16 April). But insurers have taken it seriously since at least 2009, when a representative of Munich Re wrote: “Climate change probably already accounts for a significant share of economic losses from weather-related natural catastrophes in the period since 1980, which totalled $1.6tn (in original values).“In the light of these facts, it is disappointing no breakthrough was achieved at the Copenhagen climate summit in December 2009. At Munich Re, we look closely at a multitude of risks and how best to handle them. Risks that change in the course of time are especially hazardous.  is just such a risk of change.”But even the premium increases 10 years later don’t appear to have cut emissions sufficiently. So the Bank of England must convince the government to take more effective action. For example, as in the second world war, introduce rationing of any production of greenhouse gases. Are US college courses teaching how not to be duped by bullshit really necessary (, theguardian.com, 17 April)? If students haven’t developed their critical thinking faculty by the time they get to college, they are probably lost to the agencies of disinformation and manipulation.In Britain, it is obvious that our education system, designed as it is to provide compliant labour to increase the wealth of a few, has failed when its cities are filled with humanity-saving, peaceful demonstrators. It is inspirational to observe their ability to recognise what is truly important and disregard the odium of passersby – normal people going about their business, in many cases to finance or produce goods harmful to humanity and the natural world. These protesters are the freethinkers who have escaped the bullshit net. In , Naomi Klein defines one legacy of the free market: “In virtually every country the political class accepts the premise that it is not the place of government to tell large corporations what they can and cannot do, even when public health and welfare – indeed the habitability of our shared home – are clearly at stake.” In the streets, yes, but in the ballot box we bring about the inevitable and dismiss our free-market political class. We build a new system. I admire Ben Smoke’s action at Stansted (, 16 April), but disagree with him about arrest, though agree about not glorifying it and being clear about the consequences.I am a Quaker, a psychotherapist member of the Climate Psychology Alliance, which aims to support activists therapeutically, and a member of Extinction Rebellion. What we need is a mass movement with arrest as a possible and necessary part of it. When thousands join us in solidarity and put this issue before everything else, the state will have to listen and take action."},

With , this number is likely to have fallen, so reports that cell space is under pressure are credible. protesters, activists and legal observers have told Guardian reporters some of those arrested are being taken to police stations outside London, with several saying demonstrators are being taken to Luton, while others mentioned Brighton and Essex.The Met would not confirm or deny the claim. “Those who have been arrested are being taken to MPS custody suites throughout ,” a spokesperson said. “Contingency plans are in place should custody suites become full. We will not discuss [the matter] further for operational reasons.”However, despite the volume of arrests, anecdotal evidence from those on the ground suggests the police are approaching the protests with a distinctly lighter touch. One legal observer said the diminishing capacity might be a reason why police were arresting people so slowly. “The other thing is that if they come in and do a mass arrest, they might lose public support,” she added.Policing protests has long been a sore point for the Met, with the  at the G20 summit demonstrations in 2009 leaving a lasting mark on the force’s reputation, as did the scenes of kettling at the student protests in 2010.There is a sense the Extinction Rebellion protests are being policed with a strict adherence to guidelines on public order policing. Forces are supposed to follow six principles when policing public order operations, according to the College of Policing, the professional standards body.Under “policing standards and tone”, commanders need to set the style and tone at the start of an operation and be aware of the potential impact on public perceptions. Under “communication”, police are told to “use engagement and dialogue whenever possible”, and “establish and maintain links with communities, groups, partners, event organisers”.Under “proportionate response”, officers are told to “demonstrate consideration and application of relevant human rights principles”, and police powers should be used appropriately and proportionately.The legal framework sets out statutory and common law powers in relation to public order policing, which must be used in accordance with the European convention on human rights. The relevant acts include the Public Order Act 1986 and Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994."},

Just after 11am, three people glued themselves to a train at Canary Wharf station, causing delays on the Docklands Light Railway.A few hours later, four protesters glued their hands together and chained themselves to a fence outside Corbyn’s house, saying he was “the best hope this country has got” to meet the challenges of the climate crisis, adding that they were there to “support him” to go further.Thousands of people, including parents and young children, pensioners, scientists and environmentalists, have taken part in  protests.On Wednesday afternoon, the four sites that protesters had occupied in London since Monday – Marble Arch, Waterloo Bridge, Parliament Square and Oxford Circus – remained under their control, causing ongoing delays and diversions in the surrounding areas. Extinction Rebellion is an international protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Demonstration have included  and . The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who 'have failed us', to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency.The Metropolitan police has designated Marble Arch as a legitimate protest site. By early evening, large numbers of police officers had turned out in force at the other three sites announcing they were imposing a section 14 order requiring protesters to leave. Several hundred officers appeared in Parliament Square, removed sparsely manned roadblocks and took down gazebos, apparently retaking the space without difficulty. However, there were reports that activists had managed to hold the space after the arrival of a samba band, while others tried to set up new barriers around the square.In Oxford Circus, police circulated among the crowd, who had been dancing all day to music from a stage mounted on a pink boat, serving notice on each.Police made a concerted attempt to clear Waterloo Bridge by walking among the crowd and serving section 14 notices on all the people assembled there, telling them they had the right to either to go home or continue their protest in Marble Arch. Anyone who refused to comply was arrested.By 9pm the Guardian had witnessed police carry away at least a dozen protesters, while many others left of their own accord. People who had already been served notice were arrested straight away if they did not leave after a few minutes.There was pandemonium at times as police officers walked through the crowd, picking individuals apparently at random. A large number of police officers arrived as reinforcements at about 8.30pm.However, numbers of protesters remained strong and cheers erupted each time an arrest was made. By 9.15pm they were led in a call and response song and chants of “whose police? our police. Whose hearts? Our hearts. Whose souls? Our souls.”On Tuesday, organisers had warned that they were planning to disrupt London’s rail and tube network, and just after 11am three activists glued themselves to a DLR train at Canary Wharf, unfurling a banner reading, “Climate emergency – act now.” Two people then glued themselves to the top of the train. Another man, who gave his name as Mark, glued himself to the side of the train. The protesters were finally removed from the roof by police at 12.40pm.Cathy Eastburn, 51, was one of those taking part in the transport disruption. She said she decided to make a stand for her teenage daughters. “I don’t want to be here today and I’m really sorry for the disruption, but I feel I have been forced to do this,” she said. “I have two daughters and I can’t sit by while their future is threatened … The government is doing nothing – we have to force them to act.”Gail Bradbrook, one of the founders of Extinction Rebellion, who was at the scene, said: “This [Canary Wharf] is the heart of the system that is bringing us to our knees causing huge disruption and chaos around the world … so we want people to pause and reflect.” A few hours later another group of activists glued themselves together, then chained themselves to the fence of Corbyn’s house. The Labour leader left his home a few hours later saying he never gave interviews, or arranged meetings, outside his house. The activists left shortly after, saying Labour had offered to meet  next week.David Lambert, 60, was one of those taking part. “We are here because we are supporters of  and he is the best hope this country has got to get us out of this,” he said. “But we need system change and a transformation of our consumer economy and we know he is a person who has the authority and power to deliver that.”The events in London are part of an international “climate rebellion” organised by the UK-based . Protests had taken place or were planned in 80 cities across 33 countries, from India to Australia, and around Europe and the US. In The Hague , activists occupied the international criminal court building on Tuesday.Twenty-nine arrests were made in Edinburgh on Tuesday night after police cleared remaining activists who who staged a sit-in on North Bridge. By 6am on Wednesday, they had all had been released and charged with breach of the peace, to appear in court at a later date.In London, Extinction Rebellion protesters, activists and legal observers said some of those arrested were being taken to police stations outside of London, lending credence to persistent rumours that the Metropolitan police’s holding cells were reaching capacity. Several people reported cases of people being taken to Luton, Brighton and Essex. The Met would not confirm or deny the claim.On Wednesday, Jace Tyrrell, the chief executive of New West End Company which represents Oxford Street and central London retailers, told Sky News the protests were hitting business hard.“We have seen a 25% drop in spend – it was £12m yesterday and obviously we have had disruption today. The impact is customers thinking they are not going to come up over the bank holiday so this could go into the hundreds of millions of pounds if we do not grip this.” "},

Deutsche concedes that the scandal has hurt its “global brand” – and is likely to cause “client attrition”, loss of investor confidence and a decline in its market value.Deutsche Bank was embroiled in a vast money-laundering operation, dubbed the . Russian criminals with links to the Kremlin, the old KGB and its main successor, the FSB, used the scheme between 2010 and 2014 to move money into the western financial system. The cash involved could total $80bn, detectives believe.Shell companies typically based in the UK . Companies then defaulted on this large fictitious debt. Corrupt judges in Moldova  – with billions transferred to Moldova and the Baltics via a bank in Latvia. was used to launder the money via its corresponding banking network – effectively allowing illegal Russian payments to be funnelled to the US, the European Union and Asia.The bank was entirely unaware of the scam until the Guardian and  broke the story in March 2017, the report says. The first it knew was an email from the Guardian and Germany’s  asking for comment.“Only with this intelligence received is it now possible for Deutsche Bank to start global investigations,” it notes.In the embarrassing aftermath, the bank asked two in-house financial crime investigators – Philippe Vollot and Hinrich Völcker – to find out what had gone wrong. Their nine-page presentation was shared last year with the audit committee of the bank’s supervisory board and is marked “strictly confidential”.The pair identified numerous “high-risk entities”. They included 1,244 in the US, 329 in the UK and 950 in Germany. These entities were responsible for nearly 700,000 transactions, the report says, involving at least £62m in the UK, $47m in the US, and €55m in .As part of its investigation, Deutsche Bank sent 149 “suspicious activity reports” to the National Crime Agency in London. Similar disclosures of potential money-laundering transactions were made to authorities in the US and elsewhere – with 30 private and corporate Deutsche Bank clients reported. Some may have been “unknowingly used”, the report says.The affair is a further blow to Deutsche Banks’s ailing reputation. It comes amid , a plunging share price and talks over a  with Germany’s Commerzbank. The raid last November came after German prosecutors alleged two bank employees helped clients launder money via offshore firms.Deutsche is also under scrutiny in Washington over its financial dealings with Donald Trump. On 15 April, Democrats from the House intelligence and financial services committees , demanding the bank provide documents about its lending to the president.Over two decades, Trump borrowed more than $2bn from Deutsche. In 2008, he defaulted on a $45m loan repayment and sued the bank. Its private wealth division in New York subsequently loaned Trump a further $300m – a move that bemused insiders and which has yet to be fully explained.In recent years, the bank has had a series of bruising encounters with international regulators. Between 2011 and 2018, it paid $14.5bn in fines, with exposure to dubious Russian money a regular theme.In 2017, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority  – £163m – after Deutsche carried out a $10bn  run out of its branch in Moscow. The New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) fined the bank $425m over the same case, in which roubles were converted into dollars via fake trades on behalf of VIP Russian clients.Deutsche carried out an internal investigation into the “mirror trades” affair, “Project Square”. The leaked Global Laundromat report says there is “no systematic link” between the two Russian money-laundering schemes. However, it suggests some overlap. Two unnamed entities feature in both and 46 “mirror trade” entities “directly transacted” with 233 laundromat ones.The leaked report says Deutsche has cleaned up its act. It says it has stopped doing business with the two banks at the centre of the Laundromat scandal – Moldova’s Moldindconbank and Latvia’s Trasta Komercbanka. Regulators in Latvia closed down Trasta in 2016 because of serial money-laundering violations.Deutsche Bank says it has “reduced its footprint” across the post-Soviet region. It no longer has relationships with any banks in Moldova, Latvia, Estonia and Cyprus, the report says. All are favourite destinations for illicit Moscow money. The bank has scaled down its business activities in  and Ukraine, it says.The bank is under investigation for its role in Europe’s biggest banking scandal, involving Denmark’s Danske Bank. Danske laundered €200bn (£178bn) of Russian money via its branch in Estonia. Deutsche provided correspondent banking services via its US subsidiary.Deutsche Bank said it could not comment on “potential or ongoing investigations”, or on “any matters regarding our regulators”. It said it was committed to providing “appropriate information to all authorised investigations”.The bank said: “We have considerably increased staff numbers in anti-financial crime and more than tripled our staff since 2015. Since 2016 we have invested €700m in upgrading our key control functions there.”"},

Higher exports of autos and airplanes do the trick, but the recent downward trend appears to stem from one-off events that probably aren't sustainable.  The gap between US imports and exports fell to $49.4bn in February, down from $51.1bn in January. That’s an eight-month low.The reduction was driven by higher exports of autos and airplanes and a smaller gap with China and Europe.The goods deficit with China dropped 28.2% to $24.8 billion. Exports to China rose 18.2% to $8.4 billion. Imports from China fell 20.2% to $33.2 billion, according to today’s data.February US trade data are out.

This could be a sign that Donald Trump’s trade war with China is finally succeeding, and that Beijing has begun buying more US goods.US Feb Trade Balance: soybean exports increased to $1.4 billion or 15.4% which is due in part to gradual unwinding of the US-China trade spat.However.... last week , so the picture is a little confusing. If you’re just tuning in, here’s  on the UK house prices slowdown, and March’s inflation data: across Britain have increased at their slowest rate for more than six years, with London experiencing its biggest slump in a decade as Brexit concerns drag on growth.The  said average house prices in the UK rose by 0.6% in the year to February, the lowest rate of growth since September 2012, and down from a rate of 1.7% in January.The price of an average  home fell by 3.8% on the year, the steepest drop since the depths of the last recession in mid-2009, and faster than the 2.2% decline recorded in the year to January.The consumer price index (CPI) measure of inflation unexpectedly remained at 1.9% in March, unchanged from a month earlier, offering some respite for UK households.Interest rates on loans for students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland will, however, rise by up to 5.4%, after the March retail price index (RPI) measure of inflation came in at 2.4%.More here:Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at EY ITEM Club. reckons UK house prices could easily stagnate through the rest of 2019, given consumer caution.He says that today’s house price data:....very much fuel the overall impression that the housing market is being hampered as buyer caution amid already challenging conditions is being reinforced by recent heightened Brexit and economic uncertainties – although there are significant variations across regions with the overall picture being dragged down by the weakness in London and the South East.George Buckley, Nomura’s chief UK and European economist, has produced this chart showing how house prices in the North West of England have outperformed London since 2017.He says:The divergence is probably reflective of a number of factors – weaker global growth over the past year and Brexit having dampened London prices, as has general overvaluation in the capital, while regional prices being supported by the more traditional drivers of the housing market – i.e. rising wages, employment and low interest rates.Berlin now expects the German economy will only expand by 0.5% during 2019, only half as fast as previously expected.This followed weak economic data, particularly in the factory sector, in recent months. It’s a blow to hopes that Germany would bounce back from its economic problems last year (its economy contracted slightly in the second half of 2018).In line with reports that had appeared last week, the  government halves its forecast for  growth in 2019 to just 0.5% from 1.0%, primarily due to the woes of the  sector. Sees growth improving to 1.5% in 2020, driven by consumer Germany cuts growth projection to 0.5%...a year ago same survey called for growth of 2.1% just wow.Here’s the regional breakdown of the latest UK house price data, showing that England is still the priciest place for housing. are another factor, experts say, as they’ve wiped out many of the profits from buying a house and renting it out. , housing partner at law firm , predicts that house prices will keep falling:“The death of buy to let, increased stamp duty and the prospect of interest rate hikes combined with Brexit instability makes the downward trajectory of house prices predictable. This decline looks set to continue for the foreseeable future.“One way to curtail non-resident buyers, who have stoked the residential property market in the south east, is to increase stamp duty further. While Government is consulting on this now, many would argue its impact will be minimal given the housing market is already in decline in London, particularly in the premium market. A one per cent surcharge is unlikely to reverse this trend in the short term.”The average London house price is now £460,000, more than double the national average of £226,000 in February.In the South East, the average house price is £316,000, down from £321,000 in January.The North East is still the cheapest place for property, at £125,000 on average. That means they’ve still not reached their value before the 2008 financial crisis.UK house prices have actually been falling since last August, a clear sign that the market has cooled:House price inflation was 8.2% in June 2016, when Britain voted to leave the EU. It’s now just 0.6%, as Brexit uncertainty has deterred some people from risking a house move.The ONS’s head of inflation Mike Hardie says:“Annual house price growth has slowed to the lowest rate in close to seven years.Growth in Wales and the west of England was offset by a sustained fall in London and falling prices in the South East for the first time since 2011.House prices across the South East declined by 1.8% in the year to February, the Office for National Statistics reports.That’s the first annual decline since October 2011, and the biggest fall since September 2009.House prices in the capital shrank by 3.8% year-on-year in February, the biggest fall since 2009. That’s rather worse than the 2.2% decline recorded in January, showing that the housing slowdown has gathered pace.Prices rose in other parts of the UK, with the North East of England particularly strong."},

House prices slipped across the south-east of England, while there was zero growth in Yorkshire and the Humber, and prices fell in the north-east. values are, however, racing ahead in the Midlands and the north-west, where the average value of a home is below the national average of £226,000. While London house prices fell over the year, the capital remains the most expensive place in Britain to buy a property, at an average of £460,000.The snapshot comes after Labour floated the idea of a  to keep a lid on the growth in property prices across the country. It is still only an idea, and the party has not explained how the policy would work in times when house price growth was slowing, or how it might vary to cope with different rates of growth across the country.The Office for Budget Responsibility, the government’s economic forecaster, expects average house prices across the country to fall this year. Prices across the country have, however, risen over the past two decades to seven times the average full-time wage, up from four times wages in the late 1990s. Economists have said that the acceleration in prices in recent years meant price growth was always bound to ease as homes became unaffordable.Economists also said uncertainty around  was holding back growth, particularly in the London housing market, after years of prices rising above inflation.Price growth has been slowing since the middle of 2016, with a decline in the number of transactions following the  as the heightened political uncertainty put many homeowners off moving.

This also followed a WTO ruling against Airbus subsidies.“The EU has taken advantage of the US on trade for many years.

The two sides have been battling for almost 15 years at the WTO over the subsidies given to Boeing and .The EU’s trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmström, said she wanted to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war with Washington, and called for Trump to come to the negotiating table. “European companies must be able to compete on fair and equal terms,” she said. “The recent WTO ruling on US subsidies for  is important in this respect. We must continue to defend a level playing field for our industry.“But let me be clear: we do not want a tit-for-tat.

The new rules would apply to the UK after Brexit, as the government is committed to emissions standards that are at least as ambitious as current arrangements governed by the EU.Separately, the National Infrastructure Commission (NIC), which is appointed by the Treasury, on Wednesday said British ministers should ban the sale of new petrol and diesel heavy goods vehicles no later than 2040, matching a similar .The vast majority of goods vehicles on British roads run on diesel because of its higher fuel efficiency. However, the NIC said that the industry would be able to move to  and  in the early 2020s.The haulage industry and business groups have strongly objected to the NIC’s proposals. Richard Burnett, chief executive of the Road Haulage Association, described the proposed ban as “simplistic”, not realistic and not credible given the lack of alternative fuel sources for long-haul heavy goods vehicles.The tougher attitude towards lorries comes amid a crackdown on carbon emissions across the road transport sector. From 2021, EU carmakers will have to meet an average CO emissions target for new cars of 95g per kilometre.The looming deadline has raised the prospect of carmakers paying billions in fines for failing to improve their carbon footprint. Only Tesla and Smart already meet the target out of 50 major brands, according to  by Jato Dynamics, a data company. Jato suggested the car industry could pay as much as €33.6bn (£29bn) in fines from 2021 if it remained at 2018 emissions levels.However, Transport & Environment (T&E), a Brussels-based campaign group, has raised multiple concerns that carmakers are using loopholes to game the system, avoiding the penalties.T&E highlighted the potential for carmakers to sell “fake” electric cars, hybrids that mainly rely on petrol power alongside a little-used, low-range electric motor. Selling more electric vehicles means carmakers are allowed to meet less stringent carbon-reduction measures. is planning to use another loophole to avoid a big fine for producing dirty cars, reportedly paying Tesla hundreds of millions of euros so that the US carmaker’s electric vehicles – with zero direct carbon emissions – are included in its fleet.Pooling emissions in this way is legal but means that the carmaker’s overall carbon emissions will likely fall more slowly than if it stopped producing cars that run on fossil fuels.An Fiat Chrysler spokesman said: “The purchase pool provides flexibility to deliver products our customers are willing to buy while managing compliance with the lowest-cost approach.”Julia Poliscanova, T&E’s manager of clean vehicles and emobility, said: “Fiat bet excessively on diesel technology and now is paying the cost of declining diesel sales due to the air pollution crisis in our cities.“They could have followed other paths to make cleaner cars and thus meet the CO targets, like accelerating sales of electric cars or converting some of their heavy-polluting SUVs as plug-in hybrids. At one point, bad business choices come back to haunt you.”Miriam Dalli, a Maltese Labour MEP who was part of the negotiations on the EU carbon limits, told the Guardian the rules had faced fierce opposition from the industry and some member states, including industry-backed studies with “unrealistic assumptions that led to totally misleading results”.She added that the European commission would also test cars under real-world conditions to avoid a repeat of the , in which Volkswagen installed software to trick emissions tests."},
{"title": "Would life be happier without Google? I spent a week finding out", "time": "Wed 17 Apr 2019 ", "category": "Tech", "tags": "Google,Google Maps,features", "content": "alfway through my week without , my wife mentions that she would like to go out to see a film that evening, and I agree to deal with the logistics. In what I initially think is an inspired move, I drop by the local cinema on the way home and scribble down all the film times in my notebook. Then my wife insists on going to a different cinema.“Can I do this by phone?” I ask her. “Is 118 still a thing?”Turns out it is, and an expensive one: £2.50 a call, plus 75p a minute, plus a 55p access charge from my mobile provider. But more than a million people a year still use the service, and it even offers a text facility that answers questions – although you’re essentially just asking someone to Google something for you and text you back, for £3.50 a go.Before I started this experiment, when I tried to imagine what it would be like to take a break from Google, what I was really trying to remember was how my life worked all those years before it started.Google was founded in 1998. Thinking back to the mid-90s, I dimly recall visiting libraries in the course of my work as a journalist, and having fat envelopes of press cuttings delivered to my door. I remember tracking down Meat Loaf’s out-of-print autobiography in a secondhand bookshop the day before interviewing him. But often, I never found the answers I was looking for. Instead, I adjusted the questions.I remember factual disputes in pubs and at dinner parties that simply never got settled. I remember finding my own way around town. I remember learning straightforward repairs from books instead of videos. I remember doing all of these things, but I don’t really remember how it felt.To get Google out of your life is a big undertaking.  doesn’t just get you to places; it drives many of the other apps you use, including Uber. Google owns YouTube. Google controls my thermostat.For the purposes of this experiment, I am simply avoiding the maps, the search engine, the browser and YouTube. I am going to keep using email. There are, of course, other browsers, search engines and map apps out there, but I am not trying to find substitutes. I am trying to do without.My reasons have little to do with Google’s monopoly on searching, or its free and easy way with my data. I am worried it is doing something to my brain. Actually, I am worried that Google is my brain.In his book The Shallows, Nicholas Carr describes familiar symptoms while trying to absorb text of any length: “My concentration starts to drift after a page or two. I get fidgety, lose the thread and begin to look for something else to do.” The book’s main contention is that our highly plastic brains are being rewired by the demands of online existence: an increased knack for mental multitasking comes at the price of our ability to think deeply. Google, he says, is a huge part of this: “Google is, quite literally, in the business of distraction.”The Shallows was published in 2010, and it is unlikely anything has improved since then. Carr maintains that the rise of the smartphone, along with social media, has magnified the problem considerably. “A decade ago, you could still make a distinction between ‘online’ and ‘offline’,” he tells me in an email. “We spent a lot of time on the internet, but we didn’t live there. Now, we do. Today, essentially, people are always online.”Google receives 63,000 searches every second, about 2tn a year, accounting for more than 90% of the global search engine market. It is said that the average person performs three to four searches a day, but a glance through my browser history before shutting Google down shows I regularly exceed 20. Many of these are purposeful; many more are not. Two weeks ago, I found and ordered the precise replacement part I needed for my broken coffee machine. But I also searched for the name of someone I’d met the night before; a definition of China’s One Belt One Road development strategy; a catflap door; a list of Balkan cities (cheating at a crossword); the local recycling timetable; what toothwort is; and “Yul Brynner as robot with face plate removed”.For my own sanity, I need a break.When I moved house two years ago, I started to rely on Google for navigation. Now, I am utterly dependent. I don’t just want to know the way – I want to know the best way, as of this minute. I can’t remember the last time I gave a thought to where anything was.“How do I buy an A-Z?” I ask my wife.“I don’t even know that you can,” she says. I think: Google would know.A-Zs are still widely available, as I discover after I take the bus to the closest bookshop on my severely depleted mental map. While I am there, I run across a book called Offline – which promises to help me “avoid the potentially disastrous side-effects of digital pollution”. I am reminded how big a role serendipitous discovery used to play in pre-Google research.On the way home, I drop by my nearest library for the first time. It is a tiny branch, and the computing section is mostly dedicated to programming manuals, a fair number with the words “for Dummies” in the title. Everybody else in the room is looking at Google. I am sure this borough has a bigger central branch, but I have no idea where it is. An A-Z only works with an address. You can’t just look up “library”.Later, I find my son in the kitchen, making tea. He was born in 1999, so he has never known a world without Google.“So, it’s the first day of my week without Google,” I tell him.“You’re switching search engines?” he asks.“No, that’s not the point,” I say.“What is the point?”“The point is to remember what it was like before,” I say. “You have no idea how people used to find out stuff.”“You just had to hope someone else knew,” he says.“There were systems in place,” I say, “of which you know nothing.”“Without Google, the issue was how to get the answer,” he says. “With Google, the issue is the answer.”“Let’s say you wanted to know about brain surgery,” I say. “First, you would …” I stop there. I can’t remember.I spend the morning in my home office, unsure about how to proceed with, well, anything. Once again, I ask myself: how did this work in 1997?I remember that, back then, I bought three or more newspapers every day, and kept all the copies until the end of the week. I still have a basic printed reference library – dictionaries of biography, film, literature, etymology, quotations, etc – but nothing has been updated for 20 years. I once owned a handy encyclopedia on CD-Rom, but that went the way of the CD-Rom drive.For reassurance, I return to the book I bought – Offline, by Imran Rashid and Soren Kenner – which explains that while Google may be great for finding facts and coffee machine parts, its primary purpose is to deliver me to advertisers, as part of a system designed to make sure I am never not shopping: “Think of it as a complete set of rails laid out in front of you and designed to keep you engaged by exposing you to a number of different approaches.”I think about a jacket I searched for last week, which I decided was too expensive, and which haunted every webpage I visited afterwards, floating above the text I was reading as if to say: look what you forgot to buy.As the authors point out, there is a reason I had this miraculous, free, search facility – and all the knowledge it could locate – at my fingertips. “The equation is actually very simple if you look at it as a reversal of the traditional vendor-consumer relationship,” they write. “Your attention is the commodity.” Competition for my attention is fierce, and the result is that I am inattentive to almost everything else. As the book reminds me, before the advent of smartphones “most of us could hold 20 or even 50 phone numbers in our head”. Today, I know precisely four: my parents’ home phone – unchanged for 55 years; my dad’s office number – not in use for 15; my wife’s mobile; and mine.A Guardian photographer follows me while I navigate through London with my A-Z, but I can tell he is frustrated and wants to use his phone. I keep dropping things into the conversation such as: “I wonder how you go about getting a British Library card?”, hoping he might be able to tell me. I think about what my son said – “You just had to hope someone else knew” – and I realise my primary research tool was, and still is, the stupid question. When you ask Google, nobody has to hear.It’s the day of my wife’s proposed cinema visit, and 118 connects me to the cinema chain’s recorded phone menu, which refers me to the website for film times and hangs up on me. I ring back and select the booking option. After a 10-minute wait, I am connected to a charming woman who seems to have nothing but time. She runs me through the whole film schedule twice, and describes the interior of the cinema in some detail so I can choose my seats. I have a little trouble making up my mind. “No worries at all,” she says. “Is there a card in your name we’ll be popping this on to?” I can’t figure out why she’s being so patient, until I realise she’s assuming I am very old. Otherwise, I would be doing this online.That evening, following her precise instructions, I show my credit card to the man at the popcorn till. He looks up my name and prints out my tickets. “It’s like shopping by candlelight,” I say.At a small library I run across by accident, I make a random discovery: in a thick binder labelled “local info” is a book that contains the addresses of every library in the country. I take a picture of the listing for my local main branch – Ealing central library – and head off.Navigating by A-Z again is an eye-opener. You need to keep your head up to read street signs and posted bus routes, and there are still plenty of “now what?” moments, not least when I get off the bus where the library is supposed to be, and there is nothing remotely library-shaped on the horizon.It transpires Ealing central library is located inside the Ealing Broadway shopping centre. After a speculative wander, I find a sign, then another, directing me to the first floor. The library, it turns out, is closed – not for the afternoon, or the day, but since August, for renovations.I don’t know what to do with myself. What is the point of having a computer if you can’t look things up on Google? Yes, I do have some work to do, but the days of deprivation have done nothing to restore my attention span. In the afternoon, a slim package arrives: my long-awaited coffee machine part, essentially a knob. Thanks to Google, it is the precise knob for my model, but it’s missing the small plastic insert that was the actual broken bit. Without it, the knob is useless.At this point I feel very close to quitting the experiment because I really want that plastic sleeve. With a heavy heart, I pull the invoice from the bin, ring the number on it and listen to eight minutes of hold music. Eventually, a woman, Vivienne, picks up. I describe my problem.“It’s a little plastic piece, like a sleeve,” I say.“No idea what that would be,” she says. “Can you find a picture of it and give me the model number?”“I can’t get online,” I say.“That’s fine,” she says. “What about an email address?”“Yes,” I say. “I’m allowed email.”She sends me an exploded illustration of my coffee machine with all the parts numbered.“I don’t see it there, Vivienne,” I say. “Unless it’s embedded in the knob.”“I’m afraid you’ll have to call the manufacturer,” she says. “Do you want the number?”The manufacturer answers with a recording telling me that the service department is closed on Friday afternoons.It’s probably fair to say that Google is inescapable, unless you resign yourself to getting nowhere without it. I spent so much of my week being either lost or bewildered, when the basic solution to my immediate problem might have been at my fingertips.But it wasn’t a waste. I got almost nothing done, but, while I was out there, I did a lot of looking and I bought a lot of stuff. I even found a version of that jacket I liked in a shop, for a third of the price. Now when it hovers over the webpage I am on, saying: “Buy me!”, I’ll be wearing it. I briefly reclaimed the ability to walk through the world with maximum inefficiency, relying on random discoveries, luck, the kindness of strangers and the patience of phone operators.I return to the email Carr sent me. “Constant connectivity has become so habitual (and so expected by society) that brief breaks just aren’t going to be sufficient to retrain the brain to relax, resist distraction and concentrate,” he writes. “At this point, the craving for the screen’s stimulations is pretty deeply engrained in most people’s psyches.”This may be the main problem: Google and the other major platforms have got very good at keeping our attention. The price we pay is endless inattention to the world around us. And that’s not all Google’s fault. “Thanks to some combination of laziness, gullibility and vanity, we have proven ourselves all too eager to embrace a culture of distraction and dependency,” said Carr. “We could have said no.”One of the great impositions of modern life is the obligation to go everywhere forewarned and forearmed, to access timetables, reviews and instructions ahead of even the simplest tasks, for the sake of a frictionless existence. Once, it was creepy to Google someone just before you knew you were going to meet them. Now it’s sort of required.I am not nostalgic for an era of bank queues, closed shops and being lost. I am glad to be relieved of the obligation of social interaction just to access a bit of information, because people are not always helpful, patient or fun to talk to. But for all that Google has given us, we have paid a price: we’re well on our way to eliminating the element of surprise from our lives and, with it, joy.I don’t think it is too late to reclaim some of our attention back. My brain responded pretty well to the time off. Even Carr is not wholly pessimistic about the future. “I wouldn’t rule out the emergence of a counterculture that rejects digital media entirely – a kind of echo of the ‘back to nature’ movement of the 60s,” he wrote. “That may be wishful thinking on my part, but you never know.”"},

The bank escaped financial penalties in the UK. Instead, Staley was fined £642,430 and Barclays was asked to file annual reports detailing whistleblowing allegations against the bank’s senior managers.Another instance concerns the collapse of Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBoS) and its takeover by Lloyds following the 2008 banking crash, which many believe should have resulted in the former HBoS executives being barred from the City and fined. Sadly, a report is still pending.Separately, a study by the FCA of a  is still under wraps after more information came to light last year.Some movement is discernible. The watchdog’s inability to pursue executives at Royal Bank of Scotland’s Global Restructuring Group unit following the  will trigger a broader report later this year on exactly how far the FCA’s regulatory “perimeter” extends.This after FCA lawyers ruled that small businesses lay outside the scope of its sanctions regime and nothing could be done to bring a case against RBS.Andrew Bailey, the FCA’s chief executive, is at pains to say how difficult the regulator finds defining a border when the instinct of almost every finance firm is to jump outside if it possibly can.His example is funeral plans, which until a couple of years ago were mostly considered insurance policies and were therefore regulated. A ruling on the definition of what makes a funeral insurance product allowed the designers to construct plans that escaped regulation and most are now outside the FCA’s jurisdiction.The complexities Bailey highlights reveals his misgivings and the likelihood that a report on the FCA’s perimeter is only going to be a starting point in a discussion rather than a detailed plan for ministers to implement, most likely resulting in more delay.Bailey avoids the subject of climate change in the FCA’s annual business plan. It’s a financial stability issue, he says, which is a matter best left to the Bank of England and its offshoot, the Prudential Regulatory Authority.His comments follow a letter in the Guardian by BoE governor Mark Carney and his French counterpart. The central bankers argue that  if their investments in assets affected by climate change, from beachfront properties to coalmines, become worthless.Labour’s John McDonnell agrees and goes further, .It’s a message that taps into a growing realisation that climate change is less a matter for endless discussion and more an emergency, like a cathedral fire. For instance, banks could be forced to hold higher reserves if they take climate risks with their own money.Then there are the trillions of pounds invested on behalf of individual investors. Do they know their money is at risk? Bailey is in the frame if retail investors should be told how much of their Isa savings, investment trust or pension is invested in assets vulnerable to climate change. What about a traffic light warning system on all investments, mimicking the food industry sign for high levels of saturated fats, sugar and salt? This article was amended on 18 April 2019.

{"title": "The top 1% holds as much wealth as the bottom 70% of all households", "time": "Wed 17 Apr 2019 ", "category": "AU politics", "tags": "Inequality,Grogonomics,Australian economy,Australian politics,comment", "content": " new poll by Essential Research, commissioned by the Australian Fabians, has revealed that Australians greatly underestimate the level of wealth inequality. And while most voters are somewhat confused over what policies will best reduce it, a majority see the ALP’s policy of stopping negative gearing as being an effective way to tackle the issue.One of the more common mistakes is to confuse income with wealth. It’s not surprising, given we talk of people with high incomes as being wealthy, even though someone with a low income can have a high amount of wealth. The problem is wealth (otherwise known as “net worth”) is essentially a stock, while income is a flow – income looks at what your earn each year, wealth looks at the total value of your assets and debt regardless of when you gained them.And the reality is because of house prices increases over the past decade the wealth of those in the top 10% has increased by much more than has their income. The income of those in the 90th percentile grew by 32% while they saw their net worth go up by 62%:It means that wealth inequality is actually much greater than income inequality. And perhaps not surprisingly (because it is easier to gauge income than wealth when you think of someone’s occupation) we greatly underestimate the disparity of wealth in this county.Essential Research has polled 1,069 people and found that we are much more likely to underestimate how much of Australia wealth is held by the top 1%:Nearly two-thirds of people believed that the wealthiest 1% held as much of Australia’s wealth as that held by the bottom half of all households. A plurality believed the top 1% held only as much as that combined by all of the bottom 10% of households:In reality the top 1% holds as much wealth as the bottom 70% of all households:The underestimation of the wealth inequality was across all ages, party supporters and income levels, although LNP supporters were much more likely to underestimate the level of wealth held by the top 10%. Eighty one percent of LNP voters underestimated the level of wealth held by the top 1% compared to 67% of Greens voters and 65% of those who support the ALP:Not surprisingly then, after being told that the top 1% hold as much wealth as the bottom, 70% LNP voters were the least supportive of wealth inequality being a high priority – 29% compared to 59% for ALP and Greens voters:With this split in belief of the need for action also comes a divergence over how it should be tackled.Essential Research asked about three ways to reduce wealth inequality – through raising Newstart, raising the minimum wage, or stopping negative gearing on investment properties.All those surveyed across all genders and political support favoured either raising Newstart or the minimum wage above stopping negative gearing:And yet while raising either Newstart of the minimum wage might help income inequality, both measures would have little impact on wealth.Because most of Australians’ wealth is held in home ownership, that – and not income levels – is the biggest cause of wealth disparity.In 2015-16 the median income of households who owned a house and had paid off their mortgage was roughly the same as that of renters, but their levels of wealth differed by a factor of 13:It is why concerns about home ownership are not just about wealth inequality, but our retirement system. The current trajectory is for those currently in their 40s to be less likely to retire owning a home than any generation before them:And a  last year found that taxation concessions based around home ownership and investing are vastly weighted towards the wealthiest. It estimated that $1.7bn worth of negative gearing tax concessions got to the top 20%, while just 0.3bn went to the bottom 20%.Similarly the top 20% took in 82% of the total benefit from capital gains tax concessions compared to a 2% share going to the bottom 20% of households:The Essential Report survey highlights the lack of awareness most of us have about the level of wealth inequality that exists, and also our confusion over what policies are best suited to dealing with it.The ALP, as it heads to the election, will draw strength from the knowledge that most voters do believe stopping negative gearing will be effective to some degree at reducing wealth inequality:But for most voters the confusion around income and wealth inequality remains. Ironically, this may be an advantage for the ALP given its policies generally are geared towards reducing both. It may be that their voters are not too choosy – and are happy so long as inequality is being reduced in some form Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist"},

He became Facebook’s vice-president of global affairs and communications last October.The dispute has arisen over Facebook’s attempts to meet EU demands to clamp down on . The company has introduced rules requiring political advertisers to register in the country that is the target of the campaign.The EU fears this would prevent European institutions and pan-European political groups from using Facebook, Facebook Messenger and Instagram for continent-wide campaigns, including in the  in May.In the letter, seen by the Guardian, the EU says Facebook’s efforts are “both highly welcome and necessary to protect the integrity of the European elections” but “raise a fundamental concern”.The letter argues failing to recognise the role of pan-European political parties and institutions “would encroach upon fundamental EU rights and freedoms, such as free movement and political participation.

By definition, our constituency is multinational and our target audience are in all EU countries and beyond.”The letter, dated 16 April, is signed by the secretaries general of the EU’s most powerful institutions: Martin Selmayr of the , Jeppe Tranholm-Mikkelsen of the Council of the EU and Klaus Welle of the European parliament.Jourová said: “I believe [Facebook] will seriously consider the letter of the three secretary generals. These are three European institutions which have a clear message for Facebook: you should grasp and you should take into consideration that the EU is one space which has some political actors which are authorised to operate on the whole market.”She said Facebook had taken a “strict” and “legalistic” approach that had created “understandable frustration’” for European political parties.Although stressing she was not involved in the discussions, Jourová said the matter was not closed.The Guardian has contacted Facebook for comment. In an earlier statement released to Politico, the company said: “We weighed the different risks and concluded that the right solution to help best guard against foreign interference is to only allow people to run advertisements in an EU country if they have passed an authorisation process confirming they are a resident in that same country.”"},

The traffic data showed little change, with the count for larger vehicles close to the average levels between 2016 and 2018.The ONS said the figures could not be relied upon to predict GDP without its usual array of traditional indicators. However, the traffic data caught previous downturns, including the financial crisis.The experiment adds to the proliferation of ways to monitor trends in the economy.The frequency of Google search terms is often used as an indicator of shifting trends, while the economist  has used machine learning to , emoji usage and blogs into measures of wellbeing.Andy Haldane, the chief economist at the Bank of England, believes  and studying the lyrics of songs can be used to gauge the public mood.Some European countries, such as the Netherlands, have been exploring the use of shipping and road traffic data but they have not yet produced regular publications as the ONS has now done.Li Keqiang, the Chinese premier, has reportedly used electricity consumption, railway freight and bank lending data to assess growth in China, leading economists at banks to name an .

His theory is that sales remain stable in normal economic times and drop during a downturn, as consumers are more likely to tighten their belts.There are, however, likely to be questions over the quality of the new ONS data and its usefulness. The figures reveal several spikes in average traffic counts because of data issues rather than shifting trends in the economy. It also comes as GDP statistics are published more regularly than in the past.Louisa Nolan, the lead data scientist at the ONS, said: “Today’s new release draws on new data sources to give much quicker signals of changes in the UK economy than was possible before.“These new indicators are part of our radical plans to transform the way we collect and produce information about our ever-changing and increasingly digital economy.”"},

Major retailers such as WHSmith and Ryman feature  counters in some of their stores, but the majority of postmasters are self-employed small business owners, often operating a neighbourhood post office inside a shop.Postmasters are unhappy with the amount they are paid by the  for the individual transactions they process, and about three quarters (76%) of those surveyed said they earned less than the hourly national minimum wage per hour for the work they do.Their biggest concerns include falling incomes and higher costs, low transaction rates for banking services, more customers using Royal Mail services directly via the internet, and fewer using a Post Office card account.Calum Greenhow, chief executive of the NFSP, himself a subpostmaster for 23 years, said it was easy to understand why so many wanted to give it up.“We can see how easy it would be for subpostmasters to lose faith and feel disenfranchised, to feel the system is working against them. For many of you, your feet are going to do the talking,” he said.Those who took part in the survey have been running post office counters for an average of 12 years, and 61% said they are earning less today than when they started. As small business operators, they are struggling with some of the same challenges facing high street retailers, including a shift to online.Andy Furey, national officer at the Communication Workers Union which represents about 500 postmasters, said more local communities would be losing their post offices at a time when more vulnerable members of society were already suffering from the closure of .He said: “This is a ticking time bomb. Postmasters are handing back the keys because they can’t make a living. The operating model is that they’re simply not paid enough and many are saying they can’t make ends meet.“The Post Office and NFSP are sleepwalking into a nightmare. Postmasters have been let down seriously here, with many working for less than the hourly national minimum wage.”Many of those operating local branches are struggling to make ends meet, the survey found, with one in three failing to take a single holiday last year while one in five said that they – or their partner – had been forced to take on another job to pay the bills.Greenhow said the federation would work to improve pay and conditions for its members and would challenge the Post Office to secure a better deal.The NFSP was criticised last month by a high court judge who said it was not independent of the Post Office, “nor does it appear to put its members’ interests above its own separate commercial interests”.The comments were made as part of a judgment on a case where more than 550 former postmasters are involved in  over an IT system that the workers say caused some of them to be wrongly accused of theft and false accounting."},

The introduction of mandatory age verification is a world first, and we’ve taken the time to balance privacy concerns with the need to protect children from inappropriate content. We want the UK to be the safest place in the world to be online, and these new laws will help us achieve this.”Will Gardner, the chief executive of Childnet, said: “We hope that the introduction of this age verification will help in protecting children, making it harder for young people to accidentally come across online pornography, as well as bringing in the same protections that we use offline to protect children from age-restricted goods or services.”Some campaigners have criticised the laws’ potential effectiveness. The government was forced to exempt large social media sites from the ban owing to fears that a strict implementation would result in sites including Twitter, Reddit, Imgur and Tumblr being blocked for adult content.Additionally, concerns have been raised that the laws could result in the creation of a database of the UK’s porn viewers, which would pose a privacy problem if it were to ever leak.Unfortunately for the government’s attempts to calm fears on the privacy issue, the news was announced by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport in an email that exposed the contact details of almost 300 recipients. DCMS was also responsible for implementing the new GDPR laws in the UK, which mandate large financial penalties for breaches that expose personal data.Jim Killock, the executive director of the Open Rights Group, said: “The government needs to compel companies to enforce privacy standards. The idea that they are ‘optional’ is dangerous and irresponsible. Having some age verification that is good and other systems that are bad is unfair and a scammer’s paradise – of the government’s own making.”He added: “Data leaks could be disastrous, and they will be the government’s own fault. The government needs to shape up and legislate for privacy before their own policy results in people being outed, careers destroyed or suicides being provoked.”"},

They face between six months and 10 years in prison if found guilty. The prosecutors are also seeking to confiscate between €300,000 and €11m in bonus payments, which were allegedly boosted by the emissions fraud.Winterkorn is accused by the prosecutors of a “particularly serious case of fraud”, as well as breaching competition law. Winterkorn has previously denied wrongdoing. The installation of “defeat device” software in VW cars to fool emissions tests has turned into one of the biggest scandals in German corporate history. The so-called dieselgate scandal has cost the company more than €27bn in fines in the US and . VW has already apologised and pleaded guilty to criminal charges.The software enabled 9m cars, including Volkswagen, Audi and Skoda models, to remain below legal limits for emissions of harmful nitrogen oxides when in test conditions, while continuing to deliver the performance benefits of less stringent standards on the roads.Nitrogen oxides have been blamed for a global public health crisis, contributing to tens of thousands of premature deaths from  every year. Without the software, VW’s vehicles would not have been approved as road legal, the prosecutors said.The fallout from the scandal has hit demand for diesel vehicles across other carmakers in Europe, amid evidence that  exceeded emissions standards in real-world conditions.The Braunschweig action is one of a number of ongoing legal actions against VW and its former top executives over the dieselgate scandal.Winterkorn and five other former executives have already been  with fraud, but they cannot be extradited from Germany to non-EU countries.Former engineering executive Oliver Schmidt was  in the US for his part in hiding the software from regulators. He was arrested when attempting to return to Germany following a family holiday in Florida.Last month the US  announced it was suing Volkswagen and its former chief executive, accusing them of defrauding investors by making “deceptive” claims about the environmental impact of its cars. Investors in Germany are also seeking damages over VW’s failure to disclose the issue.Another 36 people remain under investigation in Germany by the Braunschweig prosecutors. VW also faces a group litigation from British owners of its vehicles over alleged false misrepresentation of the cars’ emissions.A Volkswagen spokesman said the company would not comment on investigations against individuals.In a statement Felix Dörr, Winterkorn’s lawyer, said the prosecutors had not given the defence enough time to read and comment on new evidence presented in the indictment."},

Net revenues in Financial Advisory work surged by 51% in January-March compared to a year ago, due to a rise in mergers and acquisitions.However, revenues in Underwriting shrank by a quarter, due to a drop in initial public offerings (stock market floats).As a result, net revenues in Investment Banking were flat year-on-year.Goldman just reported that it made $5.71 per share in the first quarter of 2019, down from $6.95/share for the first quarter of 2018. That’s also weaker than the last quarter of 2018, when the bank made $6.04 per share.The fall in earnings came alongside a 13% drop in net revenues, year-on-year, to $8.81bn, due to a sharp fall in client income (ie, from bond and share trading).David M.

With inflation running at close to target and growth slowing but not collapsing, there seems every reason for the Fed to sit on its hands for some time yet.That suggests Beijing has dropped its plans to deleverage its economy, and are again trying to spur growth by pumping up demand.The plan may be working - China’s factories posted stronger growth than expected in March of  says recent Chinese data illustrates that monetary policy is working.

They’re a by-product of distilling -- either to produce alcoholic beverages, or from ethanol plants, and can be sold as animal feed.China slapped tariffs on DDGS on 2016, claiming they were being sold unfairly cheaply in the Chinese market. That move drove down imports sharply.Now, though, the Chinese ministry of commerce says it will review whether anti-dumping measures are still needed.

Longer working hours do not automatically mean higher company profits and economic growth, and could even pave the way for serious problems ahead.Beyond the issues around fairness, excessive working hours raise the chances that mistake are made through tiredness and exhaustion.

Henry Ford, the US industrialist, adopted a five-day 40-hour week for automotive workers at his factories, boosting profits in the process. Kellogg’s in the 1930s used shorter hours to reduce accidents by 41%.Trade unions in Britain campaigned to win a two-day weekend and limits on long hours, while the British economist  predicted in the 1930s that technological advances would enable workers by 2030 to work 15 hours per week, as productivity increased economic output.In the past century, average working time has gradually reduced in major economies, but the trend has started to stall, despite gains in productivity being made.Will Stronge, co-founder of the thinktank Autonomy, , said it was not surprising that the issues in China were in the tech sector. US firms also promote cultures of longer working hours. City banks and law firms have similar issues.“This is part of the ideology, and the dominant narrative that entrepreneurialism and long working hours come hand in hand.

And yet, while the story on jobs is certainly good, on other measures it has very little to boast about.When gauging the economic performance of a government, pretty much the worst thing you can do is look at the budget balance. Whether it is debt or deficit or surplus, really we should not care too much at all.It does not matter (despite what the ALP will try to tell you) that net debt has reached record highs under the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government. Similarly, it does not matter (despite what the LNP will try to tell you) that the government is projecting a budget surplus for next year.Debt and budget balances are all means to an end. You raise debt or you increase or reduce deficits and surpluses in order to improve economic growth. Despite what the government might wish you to believe, you don’t get a share of the surplus to spend on your next holiday.So I have never gauged success or failure on the basis of inputs; I only really care about the end result. Has economic growth improved? What about jobs and wages? And crucially, what has happened to living standards?Here the story is complicated. We can merely compare the present with past performance, but the Australian economic does not exist in a vacuum – we need to consider how well the government played with the cards they were dealt by the world economy.For example, Australia’s GDP per capita has grown faster on average since September 2013 than it did under the Rudd-Gillard governments, 1% compared with 0.9%. And yet, during the past five and half years, the average per capita growth of Canada, New Zealand, the UK and US has been 1.3%, whereas during the Rudd-Gillard years those countries average a mere 0.1%:Compared with the nations with which we most compare ourselves, the Rudd-Gillard years stand out as the absolute peak period of outperformance. Even though the Hawke and Howard years were better for GDP growth, so were they for the rest of the world.If we look across the whole OECD nations since 1996, we see that the Howard government ranked in the middle, the Rudd-Gillard government was near the top (and behind Korea, of the major economic nations), while the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison years see us down in the bottom quarter, and only in front of Canada among the major English-speaking economies:The story for labour productivity is also not good. The Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government has recorded the worst average and median annual productivity growth of any government going back to the last four years of the Fraser government:On jobs the government certainly has a better story to tell. Since it came into office the percentage of adults in work has gone from 61.1% to 62.4%, and the percent of those aged 25-64 in the peak working years has gone from 75.2% to 77.5% – which is a record high.It’s mostly due to the influx of women into the workforce, but also from a halt in the drop of youth leaving the workforce and men also improving slightly:And yes, full-time work is not as plentiful as in the past, but that is a long-term issue, and even in terms of hours worked per capita, the current government has done well – although the past year has not seen much improvement:But even here some context is needed. The Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison years have been when most nations have seen a better employment picture than occurred during the GFC. Among 15-64 years olds, for the first time since the Hawke government the US has actually improved more than Australia:But let’s give them some credit. Yes, employment has grown well. But as we well know, that has not translated into increased wages.And just how badly they current government has performed is quite startling.The best comparison of earnings is average male full-time earnings, as this removes some of the downward bias we get in total average earnings or total full-time earnings, which occurs due to increases in part-time workers and women entering the workforce in lower-paying jobs.And here the story is awful.Under the Howard government, average male full-time earnings grew each year by an average of 1.53% in real terms. Under Rudd and Gillard they went up by 1.93%; and since September 2013 they have grown on average by a measly 0.01%:This translates into the worst period of growth in real household disposable income per capita under any continuous party of government since Fraser – the only one that cannot say that standards of living have improved since they won office:And worse for the Morrison government is that governments that have overseen such poor standard of living invariably do poorly come the election:The Liberal party always likes to talk up economic management – and mostly wants to talk about the budget surplus as though that is something tangible to people, when in reality it is not. When we look at the performance of this government, the story is not one that really deserves much boasting.The world economy has been improving and so it is expected that growth and employment would be better now, and yet, compared with the rest of the world we’re not exactly performing our socks off.And for all the good news about jobs, the reality is households are no better off now than they were in 2016 or 2013 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist"},

The protesters that blocked London traffic? No, a senior Bank of England official telling banks and insurers that from now on they will be expected to make global warming central to the way they operate.Threadneedle Street would never publicly endorse action that causes disruption but the speech by Sarah Breeden, head of international banks supervision, suggests a degree of sympathy with the points being made by the protesters: that time is running out to prevent catastrophic climate change and previous efforts to combat the problem have been nowhere near vigorous enough.Breeden’s  was that they need to incorporate climate change into their corporate governance, their risk management analysis, their forward planning and their disclosure policies or face the prospect of losing a heck of a lot of money.The financial markets have a term for a sudden drop in assets prices known as a Minsky moment (after the economist Hyman Minsky). Breeden said a climate Minsky moment was possible, in which losses could be as high as $20tn (£15.3tn).As one of the world’s leading financial centres, it is unsurprising that the Bank’s Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA) has taken the lead in  from the banks and insurance companies it supervises.There will be those who will wonder – quite reasonably – why the Bank is merely saying it expects firms to act in ways that show they are taking climate change more seriously rather than forcing them to do so. But when the PRA says that firms are expected to act, what it really means is that they have no choice but to do so – and they have until October to do so. That’s entirely appropriate and not before time.The period 1995 to 2007 was a time of  party political hegemony during which it won three general elections, two by a landslide. It was also a period in which there was rapid house price inflation, especially in the southern part of the country. In London, prices rose more than threefold.Yet, by allowing the property market to boom out of control, Labour was storing up problems for itself. A paper by Marta Schoch, to be presented at the Royal Economic Society’s annual conference, finds that  boost support for the Conservatives. Schoch’s research found that a 10% jump in house prices increased the probability of homeowners voting Tory by two percentage points. The research found, however, that the drift towards the Conservatives was not accompanied by a decrease in support for state ownership of public services.But that was then. If a runaway property boom prices young people out of the market, leading to a fall in owner-occupation, you would expect support for Labour to go up, especially in areas, such as London, where renting is common. Which is exactly what happened in 2017."},

A year earlier the asset manager only voted against 37 UK chairmen.This also marked a significant rise on 2016, when just 13 chairmen were targeted for falling below targets aiming to see women make up 25% of the company’s board.The benchmark meant LGIM voted against the re-election of Sports Direct’s ex-chair Keith Hellawell, Barclays’ chair John McFarlane, and Nicholas Ferguson of Savills estate agents.It also cast a vote against David Bernstein, the chairman of Ted Baker, which has been dealing with allegations of misconduct by its former chief executive. Ray Kelvin has been accused of  with behaviour including “forced hugs” and ear kissing. He resigned last month but denies the allegations.LGIM will expand its efforts to influence board diversity further next year, when it starts to hold firms listed on the American S&P 500 to the same standards as UK companies., LGIM’s head of personal investing and the founder of the gender diversity campaign group the 30% Club, said: “Frankly, it’s disappointing that we continue to have to make our voices heard as investors by voting against so many chairs on diversity issues but we are not going to go away.“LGIM will continue to be active on this issue until we see boards protecting companies from ‘groupthink’ by becoming more diverse.”LGIM, which released its annual corporate governance report on Tuesday, also revealed that it pulled millions of pounds from eight companies and voted against their chairmen for breaching its climate policies last year.The asset manager divested from a string of companies originally included in its Future Worlds Funds, which are covered by LGIM’s climate change pledge. They were excluded for issues including poor governance and climates disclosures, as well as lobbying politicians on policies that risk accelerating climate change.Where those companies were held in other LGIM portfolios, the asset manager voted against their chairmen at their respective annual general meetings.Those companies included the car giant Subaru, the Canadian food retailer Loblaws, the Russian oil giant Rosneft and the American energy provider Dominion Energy.LGIM’s corporate governance director, Sacha Sadan, said that all of those businesses had tried to redeem themselves. “Some flew over and sent delegations to LGIM to meet us, not to argue with us in terms of our analysis but [to ask], ‘How can we get back into your funds and what things do we need to do?’” Sadan said.Their potential inclusion in will be reassessed in June."},

A few months later it returned to the park and was found on the ground, dead.Scientists performing a necropsy on the creature, the first to be tagged with a radio transmitter in the park, made an unhappy discovery: it had been poisoned by lead. They are now raising concerns over whether US national parks are as safe for wildlife as they seem.“This bird had a substantial amount of lead put into its system in a very quick way,” said Todd Katzner, a research wildlife biologist with the US Geological Survey. “You don’t get that from breathing lead. It ingested something.”The bird probably ingested lead ammunition fragments from big game carcasses. Lead bullets have been a source of controversy in the US hunting community for years. Conservationists argue for the use of alternatives such as copper bullets. Shooting sports advocates say non-lead ammunition is costly and that lead has been used for hundreds of years.The topic has also become a flash point in national politics. In early 2017, the day before former president Barack Obama left office, his administration signed an order phasing out the use of lead ammunition and fishing tackle on most federal lands managed by the US Fish and  Service. The ban was overturned less than two months later by the former interior secretary Ryan Zinke.It is the third time an eagle trapped for research in the northern Yellowstone region has died of lead poisoning in the last eight years.“We know that lead poisoning is a substantial threat to scavenging birds of prey globally,” said Katzner, a research wildlife biologist with the US Geological Survey. “And we now know the threat is extended to birds that are in protected areas such as Yellowstone.”Mark Oliva, public affairs manager for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, said that in the face of windfarms and loss of habitat, lead ammunition is just not that big of a threat. “Hunters can also bury gut piles if they are afraid it will be a threat to the environment,” he said.In Yellowstone, the golden eagle population is stable with large numbers particularly in the northern regions of the park. But reproduction is exceptionally poor, said Doug Smith, a senior wildlife biologist in Yellowstone.In a first-of-its-kind study in the park, Smith and a graduate student in Montana placed a radio transmitter on one golden eagle in August and five more in early 2019 to figure out why.Smith cannot say if lead poisoning from ammunition is an overall threat to Yellowstone’s golden eagle population or the cause of low reproduction. The study is still in its infancy. But he wanted the public to know a prized species living in a protected area like Yellowstone could die from human activity outside the park’s boundaries.“Is Yellowstone as protected as we once thought?”"},

Just after 12.30pm on Tuesday, officers moved in again and began to carry people away.The protests are part of a global campaign organised by the British climate group , with demonstrations planned in 80 cities  in the coming days.The group has called on the UK government to  to zero by 2025 and establish a citizens’ assembly to devise an emergency plan of action to tackle climate breakdown and biodiversity loss.Extinction Rebellion is an international protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Demonstration have included  and . The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who 'have failed us', to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency.One of those facing arrest was Angie Zealter, 67, from Knighton in Wales. “It will take the police some time to clear all these people and more will come here to support us,” she said.“But this is a very import moment in history – it should have happened 50 years ago but at least it is starting to happen now. We are running out of time and our government must listen.”Several hundred people remained on the bridge, some of them locked or glued to a lorry parked across the carriageway.One of those glued to the underside of the van, Ben Moss, 42, a company director from Bristol, said he had been there since midnight. “It’s drastic times and drastic times need drastic measures. I am taking personal action and personal responsibility for the ecological and climate crisis,” he said.Moss said he was breaking the law for the sake of future generations. “I feel really sorry for the inconvenience we are causing and it is nothing personal, but the inconvenience we will all face if we don’t tackle this will be much, much worse,” he said.On Tuesday afternoon, police said they were taking “positive action” on the demonstration, which the Metropolitan police said was causing “serious disruptions to public transport, local businesses and Londoners who wish to go about their daily business”.In a statement circulated to the press, Ch Supt Colin Wingrove reiterated the section 14 order issued late on Monday that instructed protesters to continue their demonstration at Marble Arch and clear all other areas.On Tuesday evening, police turned their attention away from Waterloo Bridge and to Oxford Circus, where hundreds of people were dancing to music.Officers circulated around the crowd in groups, informing people that if they stayed they were at risk of arrest. The Guardian witnessed at least one person being carried away, while others left the crowd after speaking to police.“We are peaceful, what about you?” they chanted as police made an arrest. About two dozen people sat beside the stage, a pink boat, next to signs warning they were glued on and could not be moved.Jane Forbes, an activist of pension age who spoke to the Guardian on the escalator leaving Oxford Circus station, said she and three friends, all of a similar age, had come to be arrested. “We’re the gruesome grannies,” she joked, adding that she had come from the Marble Arch campsite specifically to be arrested.Earlier, at Parliament Square, protesters and tourists milled around in about equal numbers, with most concentrated around roadblocks. In the middle, people played with juggling sticks or diablos, or danced at small sound systems. Children played with oversize bouncy balls.On the junction with Parliament Street, Sarah Reddyhoff, an artist from Chesham, Buckinghamshire, had drawn a large montage on the street in chalk. She had come to visit the demonstration after meeting some people taking part while on the tube on Monday.“I think everyone wants the planet to thrive,” she said, pointing to her mural. “I have a child here, and the child is crying.” Pointing to another part, she added: “Blue planet – I put that there, because that David Attenborough film was vital to let everyone know what’s going on.”\"I have a child here, and the child is crying. Blue planet, I put that there, because that David Attenborough film was vital to let everyone know what's going on.\"Artist Sarah Reddyhoff describes her  mural in Parliament Square , one of the movement’s leaders, said nothing like this had been seen on the streets of London for decades. “What’s amazing about this is for 30 years you have just had that closing up of public space: ‘You can’t do this, you can’t do that, you’ve got to finish then’, he said.“Suddenly, what  has done is actually say: ‘We are doing this.’ And the state is so weak through austerity that they can’t stop us.”An Extinction Rebellion spokesman said though police had also issued a section 14 notice to protesters blocking the roads around Parliament Square, no arrests had been made there. “There’s a couple of police on site but it doesn’t look like they are moving at all,” he said."},

Media reports have considered that this trial was about silencing persons with controversial or unpopular views,” Vasta said in his judgement.“Rather, this trial was purely and simply about the proper construction of a clause in an enterprise agreement.”The judgement noted Ridd had been in trouble with university management for contacting a News Corp journalist and making media appearances on Sky News after dark claiming he had breached a code of conduct.Ridd had started a GoFundMe page asking for donations to fund his legal expenses and he also published material from the internal disciplinary process on a blog.A number of media articles were also published where it was obvious that Prof Ridd had spoken to the journalist involved, the judgment said.“Professionally, Professor Ridd had been concerned with the quality of the scientific research that had been published about the state of health of the Great Barrier Reef,” the judgment said.“He had published a number of papers on the need for better quality assurance. In his opinion, the health of the Great Barrier Reef had been frequently misrepresented.”Judge Vasta said the university has not understood the whole concept of intellectual freedom.“[The] university has ‘played the man and not the ball’,” he said.“Intellectual freedom is so important. It allows academics to express their opinions without fear of reprisals. It allows a Charles Darwin to break free of the constraints of creationism. It allows an Albert Einstein to break free of the constraints of Newtonian physics. It allows the human race to question conventional wisdom in the never-ending search for knowledge and truth.”The Townsville-based university’s provost professor, Chris Cocklin, noted the judgment does not refer to any case law.“We disagree with the judgment and we maintain we have not taken issue with Dr Ridd’s nor any other employee’s rights to academic freedom,” Cocklin said in a statement.“Dr Ridd was not sacked because of his scientific views. Dr Ridd was never gagged or silenced about his scientific views, a matter which was admitted during the court hearing.”The case has been adjourned for a further hearing to award a penalty.Comment was sought from Ridd."},

This has proved a valuable source of data on plastic waste, according to contemporary researchers.“This consistent time series provides some of the earliest records of plastic entanglement, and is the first to confirm a significant increase in open ocean plastics in recent decades,” the paper notes.Microplastics, defined as pieces of plastic smaller than 5mm in size, are shed by  used by manufacturers. The physical breakdown of plastic litter also creates them. Rain washes them into rivers and the sea, but they can also be blown by the wind, , and end up in fields when treated sewage waste is used as fertiliser.Studies have found  taken from the North Sea. Once ingested by small creatures, the microplastics move through the food chain. A study found microplastics in , and the pollution is also .In 2018 the World Health Organisation announced a review into the potential risks of plastic in drinking water after analysis found that .

The log shows strands of fishing twine found off the east coast of Iceland in 1957, then a carrier bag in waters to the north-west of Ireland eight years later. The paper states this was a couple of years before the first reports of turtles and seabirds becoming ensnared in plastic.Over the following decades the problem grew steadily. In the 50s, 60s and 70s, fewer than 1% of tows were disrupted by entanglements with synthetic materials. By the 90s it was almost 2%, and in the first decade of this century the increase “was of an order of magnitude”, according to the paper. The figure is now hovering somewhere between 3% and 4%.Almost half of the interruptions are caused by discarded nets, lines and other fishing equipment. Other plastic objects account for the rest. The paper said this highlighted the dangers to sea life because the sampling device was towed by ferries and container ships at a depth of about 7 metres, where many fish and marine mammals can be found. The number of entanglements was particularly high in the southern North Sea, but the authors said the problem was evident across a very wide range of ocean.Clare Ostle, of the Plymouth-based Marine Biological Association, said: “The message is that marine plastic has increased significantly and we are seeing it all over the world, even in places where you would not want to, like the Northwest Passage and other parts of the Arctic.”She was encouraged that the number of carrier bags snagged by the equipment appeared to have stabilised in recent years, and speculated that this may be a result of increased consumer awareness. But she cautioned that the data did not have a precise correlation with the amount of plastic in the ocean and was better seen as a guide to broad trends.This is the second time the continuous plankton recorder has provided essential data on marine plastic. Since 2004, samples , revealing a significant increase from 1960–70 to 1980–1990.Ostle said the plankton recorder – which has been running since 1931 – continued to produce important new data because it offered a longer timeline than other, more sophisticated studies.“I was inspired by the history, the legacy of all the people involved,” she said. “It is impressive when you consider how they have kept it going for so long in the face of many challenges.”The sampling operation almost collapsed as a result of government cuts in the 80s, when monitoring of this type was out of fashion. According to one , “It was considered to be weak science, akin to stamp collecting.”The scientists behind it kept it going, however, modernised the procedures, and the project’s value is now recognised."},

She has since been joined by tens of thousands of school and university students in Australia, Belgium, Germany, the United States, Japan and more than a dozen other countries.Speaking at the United Nations climate conference in December 2018, she berated world leaders for behaving like irresponsible children. And in January 2019 she rounded on the global business elite in Davos: “Some people, some companies, some decision-makers in particular, have known exactly what priceless values they have been sacrificing to continue making unimaginable amounts of money. And I think many of you here today belong to that group of people.”Veteran climate campaigners are astonished by what has been achieved in such a short time. Thunberg has described the rapid spread of school strikes for climate around the world as amazing. “It proves you are never too small to make a difference,” she said. Her protests were inspired by US students who staged walk-outs to demand better gun controls in the wake of multiple school shootings.Her mother, Malena Ernman, has given up her international career as an opera singer because of the climate effects of aviation. Her father is actor Svante Thunber. Greta has Asperger’s syndrome, which in the past has affected her health, he says. She sees her condition not as a disability but as a gift which has helped open her eyes to the climate crisis.Greta’s 10-minute speech was interrupted by frequent applause and ended with a 30-second standing ovation.Before she began speaking, many in the room rose to their feet to applaud and take photos of her as she sat on the podium surrounded by cameras.As the young climate activist spoke of a “”, her voice faltered. “The extinction rate is up to 10,000 times faster than what is considered normal, with up to 200 species becoming extinct every single day,” she said. “Erosion of fertile topsoil, deforestation of the rainforest, toxic air pollution, loss of insects and wildlife, acidification of our oceans – these are all disastrous trends.”She was applauded after getting to the end of the passage and continued the speech without faltering again.Greta had previously addressed the  and the  since her  triggered a worldwide school strike movement to raise the alarm about climate change.Neither was it the first time Greta had taken her uncompromising message to the EU institutions. In February, she told an audience including the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, the At that time, the parliament’s senior leaders, led by the European parliament president, Antonio Tajani, decided against inviting Greta to address MEPs in the parliament’s debating chamber. Centre-right and liberal groups argued against the invitation, which had been proposed by the Greens. Objections ranged from the potential vulnerability of a child exposed to the chamber to a desire to reserve the plenary address for politicians or senior officials.The meeting took place in the more low-key setting of a special meeting of the European parliament’s environment committee.Noting the imminent  and the fact that her generation could not vote, Greta urged MEPs to listen to scientists and millions of children who had taken part in school strikes. “In this election, you vote for the future living conditions of humankind,” she said.Referring to Monday’s in her speech, Greta called for “cathedral thinking” to tackle climate change.“It is still not too late to act. It will take a far-reaching vision, it will take courage, it will take fierce, fierce determination to act now, to lay the foundations where we may not know all the details about how to shape the ceiling,” she said. “In other words it will take cathedral thinking. I ask you to please wake up and make changes required possible.” This article was amended on 17 April 2019 because an earlier version misquoted Greta Thunberg as saying: “The extinction rate is up to six times faster than what is considered normal”. Thunberg said “up to 10,000 times faster”. This has been corrected."},

We have been peacefully demonstrating about this issue for so long with no impact that I think this is our last chance to do something in time.“I have discussed this with my family and they are very proud and fully agree with my stance on this, although they are worried about me getting arrested.”Clarke said she hoped the protest would encourage politicians “to engage with the facts and begin to create the space to take meaningful action”.“There is nothing else left to do,” she said at Waterloo Bridge. “We have tried protesting and we have tried making our case to the government calmly but they don’t listen. Now I feel we have to take part in civil disobedience in an attempt to meet the huge challenge we face. But because of Brexit it is very difficult at the moment to get our voice heard. It is frustrating because when you take a step back it is clear Brexit will be nothing if we don’t save the planet. Few people seem to realise that but that is genuinely the scale of what we are talking about here.“I hear some people in government and politics do get this … If ordinary people like me – I am not a hardcore environmentalist or activist – are prepared to take a stand and even get arrested then surely that has to count for something?”Kennedy was handing out Penguin biscuits to protesters as part of her duties as a wellbeing steward at the  event in Edinburgh. “I’m here because I’ve got grandchildren and I really think something has to be done,” she said.This was Kennedy’s first environmental protest, although she also marched against the Iraq war, and she commended the “really lovely” atmosphere. It was the significance of the protest that had brought her here, she said. “This is just so important. You have to be here – or be dead.”She said her role was to help maintain the atmosphere, keeping an eye out for anyone who looked like they were becoming upset or angry, and intervening before things escalated.Noting  in London, she said: “It’s not just happening across the UK but across the world and I don’t see it ending any time soon. It’s going to take a lot to make governments wake up to their responsibilities.”“The main reason I am doing this is because our government is lying,” said Griffiths, who was taking part in the blockade of Waterloo Bridge in London. “They are lying about issues on which there is concrete scientific consensus. For me it is totally unacceptable to lie against scientists who have spent their careers painstakingly researching this stuff.“Protests around these environmental issues have been going on for decades and nothing has created meaningful proportionate change. I don’t want to be arrested but I am prepared to do that because what else is there? Write a letter to my MP, join Greenpeace – none of it seems to make much difference, so I feel there is no option but to take a stand.”Finegan, also at Waterloo Bridge, said it was the first time he had been on this sort of protest, and it was “really positive and interesting”.“I am freaking out about the climate, to be honest,” he said. “There have been so many warnings from scientists about what we are facing, it is quite shocking. The government is not facing up to the evidence of what is happening, so I am here to try my best to get them to respond.“My family and friends sort of agree about the climate stuff but don’t really want to face it properly and many of them are not the sort of people to take part in something like this, though I wish they would. But I am terrified. It is quite a terrifying prospect when you look at the facts. That’s why I’m here.”"},

He also shared video clips of alarmist reports about American Muslims by Fox News.Carlineo’s entire profile was removed by Facebook after the Guardian asked the company why the posts remained online, two weeks after Carlineo was arrested. He is charged with threatening to kill Omar, one of the first Muslim women to serve in the . Carlineo is due to appear in federal court on Tuesday.Facebook’s  say it allows content “threatening or calling for violence in facetious and non-serious ways” and removes posts only when there is “a genuine risk of physical harm or direct threats to public safety”.Carlineo, a supporter of Donald Trump, is accused of telephoning Omar’s office in Washington last month and asking an aide: “Do you work for the Muslim Brotherhood? Why are you working for her, she’s a fucking terrorist. I’ll put a bullet in her fucking skull.”When interviewed by the FBI eight days later, Carlineo told an agent “that he was a patriot, that he loves the president, and that he hates radical Muslims in our government”, according to a complaint filed by prosecutors to the federal court in Rochester, New York.In an email, Sonya Zoghlin, a public defender representing Carlineo, said: “Mr Carlineo is passionate about his political beliefs and his right to express them, but at no point did he intend to harm congresswoman Omar or make any plans to bring about that result.”A spokesperson for Facebook, who declined to be identified, said in a statement: “We have removed this profile for violating our community standards.”Before his alleged death threat to Omar, Carlineo posted frequently to social media about what he saw as a danger posed to the US by the Muslim Brotherhood. He pushed false conspiracy theories about Islamists serving inside the US government.Carlineo lives in the village of Addison, close to New York’s border with Pennsylvania. Formerly a registered Democrat, he moved his registration to the New York Independence party following Obama’s re-election in 2012, according to public records.From 2013, he used Facebook to denounce the Democratic party. He said Obama and other senior officials – including the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, and the homeland security secretary, Janet Napolitano – were traitors. And he aggressively pushed the false conspiracy theories that the then president was born in Africa and is a Muslim.During 2013 and 2014, Carlineo shared posts that included:A  of a white man pointing a shotgun directly to the camera, together with the caption: “HOW TO WINK AT A MUSLIM”. featuring a large photograph of a bullet, with text noting that American revolutionaries shot their British occupiers. Carlineo added, in his own words, that Obama was damaging the US and people had “better wake up and do something”.A  about Obama and Eric Holder, then the US attorney general, in which Carlineo stated: “Hope you end up like the Kennedys”. John F Kennedy and one of his brothers, attorney general Robert F Kennedy, were both assassinated.A  that attacked “dictator Obama” for allegedly trashing the US constitution. The post included text that asked: “Is it time to remove the enemy by force?” Carlineo added in his own words: “It’s time.”Facebook says it does not allow hate speech, which it defines as a “direct attack” based on race, religion or several other characteristics.But between 2013 and 2018, Carlineo posted racist material and jokes relating to Muslims and pigs on eight occasions. Muslims generally refrain from eating pork products. Three of these posts were removed by Facebook following an inquiry from the Guardian.In March 2014, when a group of Muslim organisations announced a new political coalition in Washington, Carlineo shared a news article on the event and said: “Wish I was there with a bucket of pig blood.”The company’s : “We allow humour and social commentary related to these topics.”Carlineo appears to have been an avid viewer of Fox News, once mentioning on his Facebook page that he had been told he watched the channel too much. He shared video clips of segments broadcast by the channel stoking fears of Muslims in America.The footage included inflammatory claims that there were 22 “no-go zones” in the US for non-Muslims, to which Carlineo added the comment: “We need these places gone now.” Another Fox News clip he shared claimed Minnesota was “on its way to being America’s first Somali-Muslim state”. Carlineo commented underneath: “We should send them home in boxes.”Carlineo frequently returned to warnings about supposed incursions into the US by the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist political group that is influential in countries including Egypt. Carlineo falsely accused Obama and other US officials including Huma Abedin, a longtime aide to former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, of being spies for the group.Other times he endorsed Trump, who spearheaded the false conspiracy theory about Obama’s birthplace before he was elected in 2016. “This president has done more by himself than the muslim did in 8 years,” Carlineo said in November 2017, referring to Trump and Obama."},

[Edward] Snowden revealed all kind of things going on with American technology,” he said. “No one has revealed anything that we do [is bad].“They [the US] are belittling national security – national security is important and they shouldn’t belittle it. They should face up to the reality that technology is complicated and should work together to solve the problems that we can.”Peter Zhou, the Huawei executive in charge of rolling out 5G, which could be up to 100 times faster than 4G, said he American politicians and officials were “ignorant of technology” and he often had to “explain it to them like I do to my kids”.Suffolk said he had realised he was never going to convince US politicians Huawei technology is not accessible to the Chinese state. “Whether it is because they genuinely believe Huawei are terrible people or  is a terrible country, [I] don’t know,” he said at an industry conference in Shenzhen on Tuesday.“All we can do is say: ‘Guys, if you want to come and look, come and look. If you want to come and test, come and test. If you want to do verification, you are more than welcome to. We don’t believe there is much more we can do.”The US government  from American mobile networks and is calling on all of its allies, including the UK, Europe and Australia, to avoid Huawei technology in the rollout of ultrafast 5G.Last month, the UK  about Huawei software security but found no evidence of Chinese state influence. Huawei is not banned in the UK. Australia  from bidding for work on its 5G network.Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, recently told western allies the US  if they used Huawei technology. The president of Chile this week cancelled a visit to Huawei’s headquarters on Pompeo’s advice.Suffolk said: “China is just another country: it has a different value system, a different political system, but they’re just people like you or I. What is the real fear? Is it because it’s China or because the technology is better [than America’s]?“The reality is we’re a Chinese company, our founder is Chinese – that’s not his fault,” Suffolk said. “We’re very proud to be a Chinese company, but being a Chinese company means that in some quarters the spotlight will always be on you, and there’s nothing you can do about it.“America says it wants open competition but then says: ‘Huawei, you can’t work in America – you’re banned.’ My belief is America should face up to competition, it should face up to competition because American citizens will benefit.”Suffolk said that to claim the ban was based on legitimate security concerns was absurd. “I’m waiting for Mike to come back and say we’ve banned the trouser belt from being made in China because it’s a national security risk and armies can’t fight with trousers round their ankles.”● "},

Meanwhile, two-time AFLW grand finalists Brisbane face an almighty rebuild after losing their skipper and key forward this week to expansion rivals.Lions captain Leah Kaslar is heading to the Gold Coast Suns and Sabrina Frederick has been lured south by Richmond in back-to-back bombshells announced on Tuesday night.Both were foundation players for Brisbane and huge parts of their early success.Kaslar’s move to the Suns makes her one of seven players that have defected for the Lions’ soon-to-be rivals.The 33-year-old said Gold Coast’s links with Cairns, her hometown, was a big lure.“The connection to Cairns was huge, that’s where I’m from and I love that the club’s engaged with those north regional areas which is pretty special to me,” Kaslar said.“It does feel like I’m coming home here and the opportunity to work with new people and play for a club I’ve supported for a long time is a really great opportunity.”Aspirational expansion club Richmond have given up their first-round draft pick for Frederick, an All-Australian in Brisbane’s grand final seasons of 2017 and 2018.“Sabrina is a terrific player and person who we feel will fit seamlessly into our football program,” Richmond women’s football boss Kate Sheahan said.“The sky is the limit with “Sabs”, and we are ecstatic that she will be wearing the yellow and black.”Richmond appear to have the foundations of a strong list for their inaugural season, nabbing Katie Brennan from Western Bulldogs.Along with Brennan and Kaslar, a third AFLW captain could yet be on the move.Carlton coach Daniel Harford has intimated that skipper Brianna Davey will request a trade from the Blues, 2019 grand finalists, to perennial strugglers Collingwood.As Davey is reportedly keen to join an existing club, rather than an expansion outfit, the two rivals must broker a trade to seal a deal.Her Blues teammate Darcy Vescio appealed to the public to have leniency with players choosing to leave their clubs.“I think it’s super unfair for gals to have their loyalty questioned for changing clubs,” she wrote on Twitter.“We’re not on lengthy contracts for the big $ and also players literally have to move to grow (the competition). It’s not the clubs’ fault, nor players’ fault, it’s the current landscape.”"},
{"title": "Was Alex Ovechkin's knockout of Andrei Svechnikov just part of hockey?", "time": "Wed 17 Apr 2019 ", "category": "NHL", "tags": "Washington Capitals,Carolina Hurricanes,NHL,US sports,Ice hockey", "content": "Just past the halfway point of the first period in Monday night’s game between the defending Stanley Cup champions Washington Capitals and the upstart Carolina Hurricanes, Washington captain Alexander Ovechkin .Andrei Svechnikov gets into a fight with heavyweight, Alex Ovechkin, and is knocked out cold  Er, yes. A 19-year old Carolina Hurricanes player by the name of Andrei Svechnikov. Svechnikov and Ovechkin were skating next to one another and exchanged a few quick slashes with their sticks. Words were then exchanged. The two dropped gloves, and Ovechkin – who has about 40lbs on Svechnikov – landed a few quick punches, one of which was a knockout blow. Svechnikov fell to the ice, clearly concussed. Svechnikov, the youngest player in this year’s NHL playoffs, is now in the league’s , and will very likely miss Game 4 in the series against Washington on Wednesday night.Mostly because Ovechkin was involved – he rarely fights. He’s done so only four times since he joined the  in the 2005-06 season, and this was his first since 2010 when he fought Brandon Dubinksy of the New York Rangers. Ovie is no lightweight – he’s 6ft 3in and 230lbs – but has made his name as a finesse player and high-powered goal-scorer, rather than as a physical presence.The simplest answer is that it pretty much always has been. An old story goes that the first indoor hockey game was played at the Victoria Skating Rink in Montreal in 1875 – and ended with a fight. Existing members of the rink’s skating club tried to kick the hockey teams off the ice and the groups came to blows. As it happens, head injuries associated with hockey fights go back to the same day: “Newspaper reports of the time indicated a boy got mixed up with the players during the melee and suffered a head injury and that put an end to things,” Scott Burnside  on the 142nd anniversary of the game (and the skirmish).Fighting in hockey has evolved with the sport, but has long been a way for teams to either set a tone for the kind of game they’re looking to play, create energy on the bench when they find themselves lagging, or as simple retribution. Unlike other sports where it’s strictly forbidden, over the decades, fighting became built-in to hockey and its officiating – regulated rather than banned.Yes, but it’s also stopping of its own accord. Monday night’s fight was also notable simply because it happened at all. There are generally fewer fights during the playoffs, because the stakes are higher and a five-minute major penalty is too risky. But aside from that, despite hockey’s enduring reputation as a punch-up, fighting is actually on its way out of the NHL. According to TSN, the average number of fights per NHL game is . The rate of fights per game was just 0.2 as of November, down from 0.6 a decade ago, and a far cry from the 1980s, where you’d likely see at least one per game, according to TSN.That trend isn’t necessarily because of enforcement (though that’s helped), but also due to a shifting culture within hockey itself – from coaches to players – and amongst fans. Fighting’s place in hockey is still accepted, and when fights occur, fans are still excited, but as individual skill and speed has increased, fighting just doesn’t have the cache it once did.At its most notorious – in the latter decades of the 20th century – teams adopted fighting as a more obvious tactic, employing “enforcers” whose role was to protect higher-skilled players and, essentially, pick fights. Guys like Marty McSorley, Dave “Tiger” Williams, Bob Probert, Donald Brashear, Dave “Cementhead” Semenko, Tie Domi, Georges Laraque, and Derek Boogaard (to name a few) all made a name for themselves doing this job.The fact that everyone in and around hockey is so familiar with the last name on that list is probably one of the reasons the “enforcer” role has faded away, and fights have gone with it.  at 28 from an accidental overdose of oxycodone and alcohol, occurred shortly after the deaths of two other “enforcers”, Rick Rypien and Wade Belak, and it proved a catalyst for a shift in the conversation about concussions (Boogaard’s brain showed advanced  – as did that of Probert) and questions about why fighting had been tolerated for so long.Though NHL commissioner Gary Bettman has  against growing evidence that the game – and particularly the concussions that occur during it – can cause brain damage, players, fans and above all parents enrolling their kids in youth hockey are less deaf to the science.Technically, he did. Ovechkin was given a five-minute major penalty after the fight. He sat in the penalty box for the allotted time, then returned to the ice when it was over. As it happens, Svechnikov was also given a five-minute major penalty – he just wasn’t able to return from it. It remains to be seen when he will."},
{"title": "Tiger Woods’s stunning return to golf’s major highs thrilled as much for him sticking it to the old guard as it did for pure sporting spectacle", "time": "Wed 17 Apr 2019 ", "category": "Golf", "tags": "Tiger Woods,The Masters,Golf,European Tour,PGA Tour,US sports,comment", "content": "s someone who cried at Tiger Woods’s  – having spent years waiting for it and much of the weekend shouting quite unprintable forms of encouragement at the TV – I urge hard-headedness about some of the reaction.Although I have limited myself to reading just the 587-odd articles about it all, it’s hard not to spot certain common themes. By far the most dominant is the idea that this is a story of redemption – that  has, in some not-entirely-explained way, become a morally better man than he was, and that that is a big part of why he is winning again.Oh dear. I do hope not. In fact, I’d much prefer Tiger to be secretly worse than ever, and still winning again. You can have one without the other, whatever the High Sparrows insist. In fact, Woods did for years. Those who seek to turn the madness and majesty of sport into trite little fables are always to be resisted, especially when those fables are just convenient morality tales. Woods the man has always been a matter for his family – no one else ever had any business feeling “let down” by him. Part of the amusing, exasperating, exhilarating nature of sport is that awful people can be wonderful at it.Inevitably, the fabulists have been working overtime since Sunday to take ownership of Woods’s return journey. By far and away the most prevalent term to be bandied around in the wake of Tiger’s stunning comeback is “redemption” – a word which connotes a quasi-religious passage from sin to salvation. This sounds like just the sort of story that small-state, multimillionaire evangelicals might like to tell themselves about Tiger Woods. And given what a grip these hypocritical moralisers already have over the upper echelons of this particular sport, perhaps we should avoid assisting them in the matter.In some ways, obviously, the need for a simple fairy story is understandable. Narrative templates are the way we make sense of the much more formless tide of experience. But Tiger Woods’s journey back from both the implosion of his personal life and from serious injury and surgery is sufficiently complicated and nuanced to defy any reading of it as the “right” one. Can’t we pick an alternative to “redemption” out of the air? Can’t we make it a revenge narrative, instead?How about Woods’s comeback being one in the eye for all those horrendous golfing conservatives – I use the term euphemistically – who were only too pleased to write him off once his Hooters habit was discovered? As a matter of personal taste, I would have preferred it if he had been greeted off the 18th on Sunday by a couple of cocktail waitresses. But you can’t have it all.Furthermore, I can only celebrate anything that Woods has ever done to disappoint what the Augusta National Club represents. His first Masters victory, in 1997, came just seven years after the club had admitted a black member, and may consequently be judged to have been a terrible upset for much of its old guard.Even now, there is no more skin-crawling sight in golf than the Green Jacket presentation in the wretched interior of Augusta’s Butler Cabin, a place of staggering charmlessness and aesthetic death. Here, competitors who have achieved sporting triumph have to sit obediently on twee dining chairs while some dreadful commercial real estate lawyer (the chairman) informs them at remorseless length that they have been a “worthy” champion over the past year, or that the club is pleased to confer upon them something they literally just won. (Incidentally, no Masters TV viewer can imagine giving a millionth of a toss what “the club” feels about anything – because the club certainly couldn’t give one about them. Augusta detests ordinary golf fans so much it can barely stand to give them a glimpse of its tournament. The sheer amount of time viewers are expected to spend watching a shrub or listening to birdsong, until they deign to show you some scores or even some actual golf, is the most naked illustration of elite contempt in all of world sport.)One of the great frustrations with Woods in his pomp, for some, was his refusal to come over all Muhammad Ali, and use his victories to make pronouncements about racial inequality in America. He was simply the greatest golfer in the world, but he wasn’t a spokesman for anything other than extremely high-paying commercial brands.The only time Woods did afflict the comfortable, then, was when his non-apple-pie personal life was discovered, and the golf-industrial complex duly forced him into a series of quite extraordinary actions. There were months of inpatient sex addiction therapy, which forced the game’s most impenetrable mind to “open up”. And then there was Tiger’s formal, televised apology for his infidelities, easily the maddest golf-related moment of the past decade (unless you count ). Should you have forgotten the detail, this took place at the PGA Tour headquarters, no less, at a podium and in front of exactly the same sort of blue curtain they use for White House press conferences. There was an audience of spectators – including Woods’s disapproving mother in the front row.It was shortly after this mindboggling horror show that Woods told his old coach he was, from now on, going to play golf “only for myself”. Quite right too. But the idea that he had to be “a different man” to win again on Sunday is cobblers, and exactly the sort that would appeal to the hardline PGA Republicans who are baptised in Disney World swimming pools. I do hope Tiger Woods keeps beating them, until they can no longer praise him even through gritted teeth."},

Enable is now top-priced at 7-2 for the Arc, from 5-1 overnight, while Sea Of Class, the narrow runner-up in last year’s Arc from a poor draw, is a 7-1 chance.A blue-on-blue head-to-head is the main attraction on the second day of the Craven meeting at Newmarket, as Godolphin’s two principal trainers field the first two names in the betting for the week’s feature event, the Craven Stakes.This race was, of course, won by Masar 12 months ago, less than two months before Charlie Appleby’s colt  in Godolphin’s royal blue colours. Appleby’s representative on Wednesday afternoon is the once-raced Zakouski, who took a novice event at Kempton in November, while his cross-town colleague in the Godolphin operation, Saeed bin Suroor, fields the more experienced Royal Marine, who took the Group One Prix Jean-Luc Lagardere at Longchamp on Arc day last year.When betting opened on the race earlier in the week, Appleby expressed some surprise when Zakouski, rather than the proven Group One winner in the field, had been installed as the favourite. The market now seems to have taken his thoughts on board and Royal Marine is at the head of the list on Wednesday morning on 7-4, with Zakouski out to 11-4.Amid all the focus on the Godolphin runners, however, what seems to have been slightly overlooked is that this may not be simply an in-house sweep for the teams in royal blue. In particular,  arrives with every bit as much potential as Zakouski having seen off 13 rivals in impressive style to win his maiden at Wednesday’s track last September. He cut through the field from some way off the pace to cross the line in an eye-catching time for a maiden and, at the prices on offer, he has to be the bet at around 11-2.Elsewhere on the card,  is a short price for the opening handicap but deserves to be on the back of a solid run in Listed company last October, while , the runner-up in last year’s Wokingham Handicap, could frustrate Brando in his attempt to win the Abernant Stakes for the third year running.  and   should go well at fair prices on the first afternoon of Cheltenham’s two-day April meeting, while   (4.35) has gone well fresh in the past and will take plenty of beating on the card at Beverley.Breath Of Air (nap)Al Hadeer Dreamfield Skardu Handmaiden Doughan Alb Brian Epstein Dashel Drasher Imperial Presence Gowiththeflow The Dellercheckout First Assignment Dingo Dollar Turning Gold Bettys Hope Lili Wen Fach Boutonniere City Tour Wentworth Falls (nb) Archive Kingdom Brunel Elixsoft Quila Saeda Tagur Jabbarockie Ripplet Parion Gunnabedun "},

Nudging 20 stone, bald as a boulder, snarling and staring out friends and foes. And that was just when he was coaching. But 25 years ago, when he was a giant young prop at Halifax, “Baloo” faced a choice. An abscess in his bowel had not healed properly and the unpleasant, debilitating symptoms had deteriorated for 18 months, leaving him pretty much incontinent. The physical and mental toll was considerable and he was desperate.“I’d had enough,” recalls Anderson, who is now in charge of the Warrington Wolves Under-19s. “Every time I went to hospital there was no improvement. I saw a professor who said I could carry on or have colostomy surgery. I’m pretty black and white, so that suited my personality. It was a no-brainer: I had the surgery. It was a means to end. It was the quickest route from A to B. If anyone asks me now I’d say: ‘Don’t hesitate. Do it.’”Stoma surgery is used in the treatment of a range of conditions, including cancer and Crohn’s disease, and involves diverting the bowel or bladder through a surgically created hole – known as a stoma - in the abdomen, so that bodily waste can be collected in a bag. There are around 120,000 people in the UK who have stomas – that’s one in 550 people.“I was mentally fine because there was a predetermined time when the surgery would be reversed. It was a temporary stall on my career – I was always going to get back.”Strangely, despite being full-time, Anderson was on a match fees-only deal at Halifax. It was an extremely precarious period for him and his fiancée. “I had two years out from rugby and no day job, so no wages coming in. Lisa and I had just bought our first house and we were about to get married, so it was very stressful. I actually got married with a stoma! Looking at the photos, you wouldn’t think anything was wrong, though. Our mindset made us stronger. Lisa was massive, so supportive, both emotionally and financially.”Despite over a year out, Anderson was still wanted by Super League’s boom club at the time, . This was 1997. He timed his at arrival to Odsal to perfection. What followed was a whirlwind of Grand Finals, World Cups and Great Britain caps in a glorious decade with the Bulls and St Helens.Although stoma surgery can be life-saving, the negativity around having “a bag” can lead to mental health problems. But Anderson is positive about his experience. “Looking back, it probably gave me a perspective to life that helped my career.

In this week’s episode I learned that, soon after American All Stars captain Vince Jones went from playing “professional” rugby league in Australia to playing union for Oxford in the Varsity match at Twickenham – RFU officials turned a blind eye – the best player in college football did the same!Army half-back Pete Dawkins won the Heisman Trophy in 1958, then followed Jones to Brasenose College on a Rhodes scholarship. Oxford used Dawkins’ passing ability to transform the line-out, spearing 40-yard passes from the touchline to midfield, leading the RFU to change the rules.

Of course, the sport is not perfect but it stacks up pretty well in terms of diversity.Rugby league had women in leadership positions, England internationals with Asian heritage, and black players, captains, coaches and managers before almost any other British sport.

Set your own goals and make your own fame.”As the 22-year-old UCLA senior gets ready to compete for the final time at the NCAA championships, she has lived up to her own words with a trio of viral floor routines that have given her an audience outside the world of gymnastics and a platform to speak out on issues of empowerment. The meet begins Friday in Fort Worth, Texas.Ohashi is ranked first nationally in floor exercise after recording a perfect 10.0 in six meets. She’s just the fourth gymnast in NCAA history to have a 10.0 national qualifying score on any event.For as much attention as Ohashi gets on floor exercise, she is also ranked second nationally on the balance beam and leads a Bruins squad that is the defending national champion and has lost only one meet this season.“I think I finally have really taken ownership of myself and me as a gymnast,” Ohashi said. “It just reminds you that timing is everything. I wouldn’t have been ready for all of this last year. I think this being my last year has set me up for a lot of the things I want to do in my future. I’ve always wanted to have a platform like this. So I think it’s really amazing.”She is using that platform to try to spread a message of empowerment for women and to stand with survivors of abuse. It’s the theme of her new routine, a reworking of the one that earned her a perfect 10.0 in five of 10 meets and got more than 117m views on social media, leading to appearances on national morning shows and acclaim from musicians, actors, athletes and politicians.The routine opens with music from Tina Turner, retains a section from Janet Jackson, and features music and dance moves from . The first one featured a medley of songs that also included Earth Wind & Fire, the Jackson 5, and music and dance moves from Michael Jackson.“That’s kind of why we decided to, you know, go through with all the women musicians and who runs the world? Girls. Like, duh, no brainer,” she said. “I feel like it is important to have that message in a platform because I’m on a team with survivors and my floor coach is a survivor herself.”The floor coach, Jordyn Wieber, was one of five athletes on the 2012 team who testified they were abused by Larry Nassar, a former doctor for USA  who is in prison for sexually assaulting patients.Ohashi always planned to have two different routines this season. She introduced the new one at the . She earned a 10.0 at the Pac-12 meet and followed that with a 9.95 at the NCAA regional meet.The change also coincided with the release of the Leaving Neverland documentary about Michael Jackson. Ohashi said removing Michael Jackson’s dance moves and music was a  because, “It’s about joy and if it makes one person feel uncomfortable then that’s never been my goal.”Wieber said it wasn’t about whether they wanted to support Jackson’s music or not, but more about giving respect to all survivors.“Katelyn has built this platform for herself where she reaches so many people not just in the gymnastics world but in the entire world. I’m just really excited that she decided to do that,” Wieber said.The music for the new routine was selected by Ohashi, UCLA coach Valorie Kondos Field, Wieber and former UCLA gymnast Ariana Berlin. Berlin spliced it all together. It also features a higher degree of difficulty with extra flips on tumbling passes and more intricate choreography, which Ohashi delivers with an energetic flair and enthusiasm that draws roars and appreciative screams from the audience.Kondos Field and Wieber felt the pressure going into this season of seeing whether Ohashi could live up to 2018, when she became the NCAA floor champion with a routine that had more than 90m views. UCLA has had , but last year was the first time it was done by a junior.“We’ve never had to top it so I knew it had to be more exciting and joyful,” Kondos Field said. “All the music that we were finding and that she was bringing to me was cool music. It was artistic. It was really great music, but it wasn’t joyful on a level greater than she had last year.”Kondos Field, who is retiring at the end of the season, said the whole experience this year has made Ohashi a better person, student and teammate.“This is a dream come true for a coach to see a student-athlete mature through celebrity,” she said. “She has been inundated with media requests and having to keep up with school and having to be a great team player and not being able to be late for work out. And she’s maneuvered everything so well like a pro.”It wasn’t a dream beginning, however.Before Ohashi arrived at UCLA in the fall of 2015, she competed for four years at the elite level and won the all-around competition at the America’s Cup in 2013. But that was her last major accomplishment on the elite stage as back and shoulder injuries derailed her Olympic hopes.As bad as the physical injuries were, Ohashi was in worse shape mentally because of the pressures of competition and the coaches. Kondos Field and Ohashi went out to lunch regularly her freshman year. The discussions weren’t about routines, but about college life.Kondos Field also challenged her to use all the time she spent on her phone more productively, like listening to TED talks.“That is literally when the little bud of a flower started to bloom, and her mind started opening up to things,” the coach said.Ohashi has been outspoken about issues that matter to her. She has used her poetry to shed light on dealing with fame, body image and anti-bullying. Her love of writing came from years of being in elite gymnastics where the only way to express her thoughts was to write in journals.She has recently discussed  on a blog she started with a friend called “Behind the Madness.”Ohashi will be riding the momentum of her notoriety for a while. She will graduate in June with a degree in gender studies. Her immediate post-graduation plans include interning at “The Players’ Tribune” and working with women affected by domestic violence.Ohashi and Kondos Field have received many requests for her time but have put those off until after the season so they won’t interfere with her amateur status.“What other time in life are you going to have 20 girls behind you in everything you do? But if we had another year, would we take it? Most likely not,” Ohashi said. “I think we both have given everything to the sport and have made the most out of what we have. It’s really cool that we get to walk out together.”"},
{"title": "The curious conservatism of Australia's World Cup squad selection", "time": "Wed 17 Apr 2019 ", "category": "Cricket", "tags": "Cricket,Australia cricket team,Australia sport,features", "content": "n Sunday July 14, Eoin Morgan will hoist the glittering World Cup trophy high above his head at Lords (preferably in fading light, the enduring image is better), before Stuart Broad and James Anderson embark on one more national tour of Dukes ball wizardry to reclaim the urn from the colonials.A few retirements may add to the pomp, too. Reminders of Nathan Lyon’s words about “ending careers” in the last Ashes series will therefore tie in nicely, and stir righteous glee as England’s quicks are chair lifted from The Oval after leading a 5-nil rout. The ball tampering jokes will no doubt be top-notch, too.The dream is justified. This year, England boasts the No 1 ODI side in world cricket, are hosts of the World Cup, and from June to October, will welcome an Australian outfit that struggles to play the moving ball on the field, and who is still yet to fully explain the sandpaper saga off it.It’s against that background that  needs to be understood. Not since club sides stopped publishing grades one through five in the major metro rag have we seen so many names appear in one go.With the exception of leading Shield wicket-taker Trent Copeland, whose fans collectively shared in his Twitter-published “face palm” emoji directly after Monday’s announcement, it seems everyone is going to be in the UK, trying to stop the England onslaught.While modern cricket thinking stresses the increasing distinction between formats, Australia’s selections across all forms still retain the common thread of conservatism.Justin Langer’s major World Cup selection dilemma was to fit five batsmen into three spots. That he leant toward familiar accumulators over game-changing power, Ashton Turner, and flexibility, Peter Handscomb, is instructive.The omission of Turner is especially so. While the collective average of both England and Australia’s ODI batsmen is just under 40, England’s batsmen score roughly ten runs more per hundred balls. It’s a gap that may point toward a greater bravery in approach, and back up the suspicion that scores of 280-300 might not cut it any more.Australia has a number of hundred makers, some of whom were selected on the back of these feats. However in 2019, the run-a-ball hundred maker may not be as helpful as the player who can strike at a quicker rate, but values their wicket less.Australia has selected one batsman that strikes over 100, in Glenn Maxwell. So has India. In contrast, England has three. If England has the fastest-scoring team, it’s fair to conclude their wickets will be prepared accordingly. If Australia is to match England’s scoring, much will rely on Maxwell, Warner, or statistically transcendent performances from Australia’s other batsmen.On questions of philosophy, Monday’s selection release revealed the central contract system’s preference not for the twenty best cricketers in the country, but the twenty most used.This means a versatile, fringe national player like Handscomb is rewarded, while an incumbent Test specialist like Kurtis Patterson is not. While on the subject of incumbents, not that the world needs another take on Shaun Marsh – who it must be said doesn’t award himself a contract – but if his batting output is the standard Australia accepts, then further batting patchiness can be expected. Either that, or at 35, he is the oldest player of promise in the history of world cricket.If the list appears a little counter-intuitive, it therefore doesn’t surprise that stories linger of beguiling contracting methods. In a Maxwell-esque Catch 22, it’s understood one player was told last year that he would not receive a 2018/19 contract on the basis of playing conditions not suiting his game, but was given a verbal undertaking in the same conversation he’d receive one the following year, where playing conditions were likely to suit. Naturally, after administrative upheaval, that contract did not materialise this year.Not that national contracts appear too great a hurdle to selection, given four of Australia’s top six in its last Test weren’t centrally contracted.Ultimately, Monday’s mass release of squads taught us that selection in Australian cricket is about being orthodox when it matters, flexible when it otherwise matters, and more importantly, somehow decoding what matters. Also, ensuring verbal undertakings are issued in writing."},
{"title": "", "time": "Wed 17 Apr 2019 ", "category": null, "tags": "Swimming,interviews", "content": "reya Anderson was never destined to stay buried in the crowd. Tall and red-haired, anonymity would be an impractical trick to pull off, even if she were not increasingly prominent in the role of British swimming’s Next Big Thing.A label pinned due to talent, says the 18-year-old from Merseyside, is one she can live with. “But I got teased for being a redhead,” she reveals. “And almost as much for being tall, which was tough. I got teased a lot. But once I started getting more confidence in the pool, I was more confident out of it.  really helped me come to terms with that.”With her schooldays soon to end once she has concluded her impending A-levels in geography and art, Anderson is primed to accelerate rapidly away from her former tormenters. The world junior champion of 2017 in the 100m freestyle, she burnished her reputation still further with two relay golds at last August’s European Championships in Glasgow.With world championships this summer, she returned to the Tollcross pool this week for the British trials and justified the hype by winning the 200m freestyle on Tuesday, with the 50m to follow on Thursday and her favoured 100m 24 hours later. The high-performance aquatic adjudicators tasked with forecasting her future enthuse about what she might achieve. Less than 18 months out from Tokyo’s Olympics, her trajectory is intriguingly upward.This all came out from very unpromising beginnings, she confesses. Anderson was never a water baby. “I remember the swimming lessons I had in sixth year,” she says. “You had to take them. I used to hate it. Somehow, I was promoted to the local club. But I was screaming and crying because I didn’t want to go.”She grins at the recollection. “I guess things have changed. I started off pretty nervous. But I started to get more comfortable. And then moving to Ellesmere College changed me completely.”Any time I feel tired I think: 'It's just over a year ago you weren't swimming at all. So get your act together'Near the Welsh border, the boarding school has been her home from home, each Sunday night to Saturday morning, since she was 14. Its four-lane pool anticipates her arrival each morning by 6.30am. “I think that’s quite late,” she laughs. Not for your average teen.The swimming programme based there, the Titans, has produced several international swimmers in recent times, including Cassie Wild, Joel Thompson, Conor Ferguson and Chloe Golding. As much as the regime has been effective, its location may be similarly conducive. “It’s in the middle of nowhere and you don’t do much,” Anderson relates. “So all I can do is school, train or hang out.”Its nurturing environs were at their most valuable when Anderson was compelled to do much less. Two years ago, a sudden jolt in her back brought a pain that refused to subside. Scans revealed inflamed joints on her spine. She swam onward for a time, picked up medals, but was paddling with ever more frustration against the tide. “There were a lot of tears,” she says. “A big lot of tears.”Being confined to dry land during her rehab almost broke her spirit. Swimming had not been this joyless since she was first ordered to take a plunge. “It definitely made me a better person though, learning not to take those hard steps for granted again.“I had to watch my teammates crush it and that made me desperately want to be in that pool. So any time now when I feel tired, I think: ‘It’s just over a year ago that you weren’t swimming at all – so get your act together.’ It all made me a lot stronger.”Her friends kept her sane then and now, she says. When she turned 18 last month, a relatively sedate meal was organised so she could be fresh for training at dawn. “No partying until after this week,” she says. Is an appropriate belated celebration planned then? “I’ve a few days off,” Anderson beams, telling us all we need to know.Subsequently, however, energies will shift from the dance floor to logging the kilometres required to make a splash in the South Korean city of Gwangju in July. There, the world’s best will make their own assessments of her threat and rivalling the likes of Australia’s Campbell sisters, Cate and Bronte, and Swedish speedster Sarah Sjöström will require an extra gear shift.Just inside the top 20 of the world rankings by the end of last year, Anderson maintains it would require an unexpected leap to challenge for the podium three months hence. “I’m not putting any expectations on myself for worlds,” she says. “I’m still quite young I guess. I’ve still got a lot of learning to do. It’s about going there, seeing what I can do and getting more experience. I don’t like to think about medals. I don’t want to get my hopes up.”Even so, she hears the chatter. And knows that 19-year-olds have rocketed from the outside lane to become Olympic champions before. “It’s a fun place to be in. When I was little, I never thought it would be me. I always wanted it but you never imagine that’ll happen do you?”"},
{"title": "Jofra Archer ‘calm and optimistic’ following England call-up", "time": "Wed 17 Apr 2019 ", "category": "Cricket", "tags": "England cricket team,Cricket World Cup 2019,Cricket,news", "content": "Jofra Archer was “calm and optimistic”, according to the chief selector, Ed Smith, on being informed on Tuesday he had been chosen for the first time for England. Smith then noted Archer went out and “bowled brilliantly” for the Rajasthan Royals, which he construed as a good sign.“He’s excited by the prospect”, he added. So is Smith. However, Archer acknowledged on Wednesday afternoon that when he received Smith’s call “I was honestly surprised and it was overwhelming for me”.Archer has not been selected in the preliminary World Cup squad Smith and his fellow selectors are required to deliver to the ICC this week. He is in the squad of 14 for the ODI against Ireland and the T20 against Pakistan and the 17 for the five ODIs against Pakistan that follow.This is the expedient way for England’s selectors to proceed. It would have been provocative to throw Archer straight into the World Cup 15 and there was absolutely no need to do that. Smith made it clear the real selection, once all the evidence has been gathered, will be made around 22 May.“He [Archer] is a very exciting cricketer and there was a broad desire to give him the opportunity to play for England before the World Cup and before we make the final decision”, Smith said.Archer has played only 14 50-over matches and is more experienced in the game’s shortest format. Smith is not too bothered by that. “There is considerable overlap with T20. He can bowl in different parts of an innings and we have a fair degree of knowledge about him.Eoin Morgan (c), Moeen Ali, Jonny Bairstow, Jos Buttler, Tom Curran, Joe Denly, Alex Hales, Liam Plunkett, Adil Rashid, Joe Root, Jason Roy, Ben Stokes, David Willey, Chris Woakes, Mark WoodEoin Morgan (c), Moeen Ali, Jofra Archer, Jonny Bairstow, Jos Buttler, Tom Curran, Joe Denly, Alex Hales, Chris Jordan, Liam Plunkett, Adil Rashid, Joe Root, Jason Roy, Ben Stokes, David Willey, Chris Woakes, Mark WoodEoin Morgan (c), Jofra Archer, Sam Billings, Tom Curran, Joe Denly, Chris Jordan, Alex Hales, Liam Plunkett, Adil Rashid, Joe Root, Jason Roy, James Vince, David Willey, Mark Wood “The IPL is a high-profile tournament and that experience also gives some overlap with the demands of international cricket. So far whenever he has been given a new challenge, typically he has taken to it quickly. Selection is never an exact science; there is always the human dimension.”Smith had consulted widely and his witnesses included Chris Jordan, Archer’s great friend at Sussex, who also makes the 17 but not the 15. “Chris has privately and publicly endorsed Jofra giving an honest appraisal, which was typically unselfish”.Not all of Archer’s new colleagues have been quite so enthusiastic at the prospect of this rapid elevation to the England team. A month ago David Willey expressed some reservations and Mark Wood and Chris Woakes did the same on Tuesday. The most striking – and surprising – observation came from Woakes in an interview with the BBC’s Adam Mountford, in which he said “it would probably not be fair morally” to select Archer, this from the archetypal, universally liked team man.Smith came prepared to deal with this problem and believes Woakes’ remarks were taken out of context. “Chris is an outstanding man”, he said, “and he answered the question instinctively. He said specifically he did not think the inclusion of Jofra would disrupt the squad. That’s also the view of the captain, Eoin Morgan, and Trevor Bayliss.“Mark Wood, another good man, very loyal to his friends in the team, basically said: ‘I really respect and admire this team and it would be tough on any of them to miss out.’“You would want a player loyal to their friends and colleagues, people they’ve been in the trenches with. I have nothing against what they’ve said and I have a high degree of confidence that Eoin and Trevor have a good handle on team culture and they endorse this decision.“We want to have a look at Jofra – and Chris [Jordan] – in pursuit of our strongest possible squad and then make an informed decision in a month’s time. We all feel comfortable with that.”Smith is right to suggest his role is to pick the best squad and not the most popular one among the players. The opportunity is there for Archer and Jordan to demonstrate over the next month they should be chosen – though since they are such similar cricketers it is unlikely both of them can make their way into the proper World Cup squad.There are precedents for successful late arrivals. Most spectacularly just before England embarked on the solitary ICC tournament in which they were victorious, the , they parachuted in Craig Kieswetter and Michael Lumb as an opening pair at the last minute. This squad have been much more settled and successful as this . Even so there is space and scope for Archer to be selected if he performs well.Smith was determined not to speculate on who Archer may replace and almost bristled at the suggestion Joe Denly could be the man to give way. “Joe has a wide array of gifts and some unusual attributes: a top-order player, who can bat anywhere and one of our leading spinners in white-ball cricket. He has a unique skill set.” Even so it would not be so surprising if Denly was the man to give way to Archer in a month’s time.One seemingly minor consideration for the selectors is this: there is an argument for one of Archer and Jordan, both of whom are superb, athletic fieldsmen, to be in the final squad if only to be on hand as the substitute fielder when the need arises – as it usually does. Both are capable of saving 10 runs an innings in the field."},

He subsequently earned the highest rating for a juvenile colt since Frankel in 2010 in the annual classification but could be scratched from the Guineas as early as this weekend if John Gosden, his trainer, feels the colt’s injury has left insufficient time to get him ready.Paddy Power pushed Too Darn Hot out to 4-1 for the Classic, while simultaneously cutting Skardu from 20-1 to 6-1 after he had beaten the 28-1 chance Momkin by a neck with Set Piece, at 14-1, nearly two lengths away in third. Royal Marine, the 13-8 favourite, struggled for running room for much of the race and finished fourth, while Zakouski, another runner in Godolphin blue, was close behind in fifth.“He had a nice race, relaxed well and showed a nice turn of foot,” William Haggas, Skardu’s trainer, said. “He’s done really well today. He’s gone from a maiden to a Group Three, so hopefully there’s a bit more in him. We can get a bit excited, I think.“James [Doyle, Skardu’s jockey] knows [Zakouski] very well and says he’s a smart horse, though he obviously didn’t run his race today. He said he had to take a pull three out. He’s in the fast lane, because he’s got a lot to learn, but I can’t fault him at the moment.”  Franz Kafka  Strong Power  Almufti Beringer (nap)  Zabeel Prince  On The Warpath (nb) Ornate   The Cull Bank  Graceful Legend  Agusta Gold  Sheneededtherun  Havingagoodtime  Alizee De Janeiro  Mystic Dreamer   Good Night Mr Tom  Staycation  Kupa River Epaulement  Ideological  Sir Ron Priestley   Canford Bay  Frida Kahlo  Gunmaker  Glenn Coco Lexington Empire  Precious Plum  Seeusoon  Frisella The bare form of the Craven may not appear unduly impressive with 17 days left until the 2,000 Guineas, but Skardu looked like the winner from the moment Doyle launched him down the outside of his field inside the final quarter-mile and he can only improve significantly for the run and the experience. It is 15 years since Haafhd completed the Craven-Guineas double but Masar, last year’s Craven winner, went on to land the Derby and Skardu too could prove to be one of the trial’s better winners.Whether Too Darn Hot lines up against him remains to be seen but the noises off are not encouraging.

Matt Salisbury (3-51) and Matthew Potts (4-62) held their composure with the ball to guide the north-east side over the line to get off the mark in the 50-over format.Durham’s day started poorly when Ben Sanderson dismissed Graham Clark and Alex Lees in the second over. Scott Steel counterattacked with a flurry of boundaries, including three in a row off Holder.He reached his maiden one-day half-century with a boundary, his eighth of his innings. The 19-year-old and Bancroft put on 119 before the opener was bowled by Liam Procter for a fine score of 68.Bancroft took centre-stage and began to dominate the  bowlers with his power down the ground, blasting three sixes at the beginning of his partnership with Richardson.

Landmarks continued as the stand reached 200, with Richardson scoring his third one-day century in the process. He fell for 102 in the final over, ending the stand at 208 runs. There was still time for Bancroft to reach his 150 as Durham posted an imposing total of 342 for five from their 50 overs.Wakely and Adam Rossington dug in to provide resistance, putting on a stand of 74 for the fourth wicket, which was only broken by a good delivery from Matthew Potts to bowl Rossington for 43. However Northants eventually slumped to a 72-run defeat, losing their final four wickets for three runs.Hamish Rutherford and Daryl Mitchell hit their second centuries of the season as 2018 semi-finalists  got this year’s Royal London One-Day Cup campaign off to a winning start with a 125-run victory over . Rutherford celebrated his List A debut for  with a ton and Mitchell stroked his fourth hundred in seven innings against Lancashire at Emirates Old Trafford.The Rapids, who have topped the North Group in this competition in each of the past two seasons, confirmed their status as one of the most powerful white-ball sides in the country by making 367 all out in 49.1 overs. In reply, Lancashire, wearing a new blue strip and rebranded as  Cricket, made 242 all out in 40.4 overs.Chris Liddle and Tom Smith claimed three wickets each as  skittled  for just 88 to win their opening Royal London One-Day Cup match at Bristol by 147 runs.

The 24-year-old, who works as a fitness trainer in Tehran, had defied her country’s rule that female athletes should dress in line with Islamic laws. Khadem was bare-headed and wore shorts for the bout in Royan.“I was fighting in a legally approved match in France,” Khadem told L’Equipe, “but as I was wearing shorts and a T-shirt, which is completely normal in the eyes of the entire world, I confounded the rules of my country. I wasn’t wearing a hijab, I was coached by a man – some people take a dim view of this.”There was no immediate comment from Iran but the national boxing federation appeared to distance itself from her. Hossein Soori, the head of Iran’s boxing federation, said Khadem was not a registered boxer in  and “in the view of the federation all of her activities are a private act”.Monshipour was warned of the existence of the arrest warrant in a text message, a spokesperson for the pair said.The Iranian federation “strongly” denied Khadem was blocked from returning or that she would be punished if she did. Monshipour, who has French and Iranian nationality, had been due to tour the country and give boxing classes. Their spokesperson added that the French sports ministry was aware of the situation.“I want to improve as much as possible, go as far as possible and show other Iranian women that they can taste this sport,” Khadem had told AFP before the bout.Iranian women take part in a variety of international sporting competitions, ranging from rowing to rugby to athletics to taekwondo. They must always obey Islamic dress rules, however, which means that sports like wrestling, boxing and swimming are currently off limits.The International  Association, amateur boxing’s governing body, changed its uniform rules at the end of February – allowing women to take part in boxing matches wearing a hijab or other garments worn for religious reasons."},

TorrentFreak’s story did not contain any links to the pirated material, although it did include four screenshots of the content in order to report the alleged source of the leak.But when TorrentFreak tweeted a link to the news story, Starz sent Twitter a legal demand to remove the tweet, alleging it infringed the company’s copyright because it linked to a website depicting “images of unreleased episodes … and information about their illegal availability”.TorrentFreak disputed the takedown request, arguing that “our article only includes a single identifiable frame from a leaked American Gods episode, to show the screener watermarks, which are central to the story. That’s just 0.001% of the episode in question, without audio, which is generally seen as fair use, especially in a news context.”The , a US-based internet rights group,  its support,  the article “is a far cry … from an infringement”. The media journalist Mathew Ingram also  the news, calling it “disturbing”.Both of those tweets were also removed after requests from Starz.

That tweet was also removed after a request from Starz.Under the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), copyright holders can file takedown requests to companies hosting user-generated content, informing them of infringement and requiring them to remove the content. If a user believes they have been wrongly censored, they can file a counter-claim, explaining why the content is not infringement, and requiring the host to restore it. The EFF says it has done so.“DMCA claims can be intimidating, especially to people who don’t know the ins and outs of the process … we’ll keep calling out abusive takedowns and helping people defend their rights to speak on the internet,” the EFF said in a statement.Twitter declined to comment. In a statement on Tuesday, Starz apologised for the takedowns, which it attributed to an overzealous third-party contractor. “It appears that in this case, some posts were inadvertently caught up in the sweep that may fall outside the DMCA guidelines,” the company said. “That was never our intention and we apologise to those who were incorrectly targeted. We are in the process of reviewing all of the impacted posts as well as the scope and procedure for the previous takedowns and are working with our vendors to reinstate any such content that was inappropriately targeted for removal.”Using the DMCA takedown process to force content to be removed is a common issue on social media.

Williams scored again at 46 seconds and finished with 36 points and made 8 of 10 free throws in as the teams combined for 64 fouls and 76 free throws attempted.Cousins injured his left quadriceps muscle in the first quarter and was done for the game, but Golden State’s depth shined and the Warriors built a 23-point halftime lead they pushed to a 31-point advantage failing to hold off Los Angeles late.Williams’ jumper and three-point play with 5:34 left pulled the Clippers within 120-117 then he rebounded his own miss and scored the putback at the 5:05 mark and cut it to 121-119.Kevin Durant drove through the paint past Montrezl Harrell for a one-handed jam and three-point play with 2:48 left, then went at Harrell the next time down and was whistled for the offensive foul. Durant fouled out with three straight offensive fouls.Cousins was scheduled to undergo an MRI exam after the injury in just his second career playoff game following a nine-year wait.

Durant had 21 points, five rebounds and five assists, Klay Thompson scored 17 points and Draymond Green 14 with nine assists.Curry followed up a 38-point performance in Game 1 to give him the most 3s in postseason history with another nice showing but Golden State hurt itself with too many miscues.The Warriors committed 21 turnovers in Game 1, then 22 more Monday – nine by Durant.Los Angeles wanted to do a better job stopping the late bursts each quarter the Warriors had in Game 1, and the Clippers were somehow able to claw their way back.Both coaches challenged their teams to be more poised in Game 2 following the ejections of Beverley and Durant in the opener. Beverley again pushed the limits but the sides avoided a testy encore, and he fouled out with 4:33 to go to roaring cheers from the sellout crowd. Durant left at 1:21."},

But few subjects have quite the polarising effect of .On one side of this divide Woods is regarded as perhaps the greatest athlete of all time, a star whose genius and dedication redefined his sport and whose recovery from ill health and raging against the dying of the light is a redemption tale sure to resonate through the ages. On the other are bloviators who take disproportionate offence at indiscretions which are none of their goddamn business and would do well to dial back the pious indignation quicksmart. Not that you will catch me taking sides.Happy to report, the readers of  were in lockstep behind the great man this week, as it slowly became apparent that the thing we once blithely assumed to be a taxes-and-death certainty, then gave up on as a pipe dream, might in fact be unfolding before our startled faces after all. Number 15 was a real live prospect.“Seeing Tiger up there, right in the mix, warms the cockles of my old, cynical heart,” oozed Matt Dony. “I’d love to see him win one more major. Just one more flash of absolute, mind-boggling genius. Go on, Tiger. One more time.”Simon McMahon channelled his inner Sid Waddell. “Could the greatest comeback since Lazarus really be on? Henry Cotton, Open champion in 1937 and 1948. Julius Boros, US Open champion in 1952 and 1963. Hale Irwin, likewise in 1979 and 1990. Ben Crenshaw, two Masters titles 11 years apart. Now, who last won a major in 2008? Seems like 11 could be the magic number.”Those 11 years since  on one paw were a slog, and not just for the man himself. It has been hard to follow Tiger during his barren spell, not least because much of the horror show could be viewed only through the fingers. The famous 12-stroke win over Tom Kite Beats Sergio García by one stroke Finishes 15 shots ahead of Miguel Ángel Jiménez and Ernie Els Eight ahead of Thomas Bjoørn and Ernie Els at St Andrews Beats Bob May in a three-hole playoff Finishes two ahead of David Duval Wins by three over Retief Goosen Beats Phil Mickelson by three Beats Chris DiMarco on first hole of sudden-death playoff Wins by five over Colin Montgomerie at St Andrews  Two ahead of Chris DiMarco at Royal Liverpool Wins by five over Shaun Micheel Beats Woody Austin by two shots Beats Rocco Mediate on 19th hole of playoff Finishes one ahead of Brooks Koepka, Dustin Johnson and Xander SchauffeleThe nadir came in 2015. During the opening round of the US Open at Chambers Bay the 14-times major champion managed to miss a 115-yard-wide fairway, the most generous in the tournament’s 120-year history, by a good 20 yards. He missed another fairway by 80 – which coincidentally was the number he ended up shooting that day.“We still believe, Tiger!” cried a fan. We did not all still believe. Attention shifted to St Andrews, where Woods had won the Open by eight shots in 2000 and six in 2005. He began the 2015 edition by flipping a wedge into the Swilcan Burn. By the 10th hole he was propping up the entire field, his top lip curling and twitching, the involuntary Elvis a micro-betrayal of his inner turmoil. At the 12th he chunked a chip that took up 30% of the historic county of Fife. The BBC cut, with uncanny timing, to pictures of a crow hopping around the links. Oh Crow! Oh universal symbol of impending doom! Oh Tiger!A few weeks later at the PGA ... well, let us allow the hole-by-hole report to do the talking. “There’s nothing like a really exasperated hot sigh of ‘fucksake’ in professional sport. Uttered in angst more than anger. Here’s Tiger, the portmanteau whistling out of his mouth with perfect comic timing after he really puts the shoulder into a drive at the par-five 16th, sending his ball into a thicket of paying punters down the right.” He missed the cut for the third major in a row. Then there was the surgery, the aborted comeback, more surgery, the prescription tablets … it was all over, surely.But that gloomy picture of the future, Brooks Koepka topping a leaderboard forever, proved spectacularly inaccurate. His back finally mended and fully rested, his competitive batteries recharged by near misses at last year’s Open and PGA, Tiger was ready to piece it all together at Augusta, just like the old days. Dialled-in approaches! Epic swinging 70-foot putts! Lucky breaks after devil-may-care teebox lunacy! There was also a narrative purity to the way he fought off both Francesco Molinari and Koepka, the men of the moment who bested him in the majors last year, and how his quest for 15 ended where it all began. No wonder the crowds went wild.“This one means the most,” wrote Sophie Mendez after it all died down. “This is a guy who publicly messed up, had it all and lost it all, but has come back to show us that our failures do not define us, they actually provide a platform for what is possible. There were genuine emotional scenes of real celebration among us who never stopped hearing the roar of the Tiger.”"},

{"title": "It is time we found out what rugby union ultimately wants to be", "time": "Tue 16 Apr 2019 ", "category": "Rugby union", "tags": "Rugby union,Sportblog,features", "content": "aster week used to rank among the most convivial of the rugby union year. In more innocent times there would be end-of-season tours, not least by the Barbarians who would head to south Wales to play Penarth on Good Friday, Cardiff on the Saturday, Swansea on Easter Monday and Newport on Tuesday, with golf thrown in on Easter Sunday. The evenings were just as hectic; the great Haydn Mainwaring famously returned to the team’s base at the Esplanade Hotel in Penarth one night to find five sheep in the foyer.In rugby nowadays such harmless fun is an increasingly alien notion. This Easter, in particular, the sport finds itself caught in a moral maze that threatens many of the values it theoretically holds dear. One of the world’s best players has been sacked for homophobic posts on social media, another roundly booed at an English league game for publicly appearing to offer his support while the latter’s club is under investigation for allegedly cheating the salary cap. Let’s just say rugby has not given up controversy for Lent.In many ways it is easier to query the Old Testament beliefs of Israel Folau than address the broader picture of intolerance, finger-pointing, law-bending and financial desperation afflicting so many aspects of the game. Everyone in 2019 can surely agree that homophobia, racism and sexism are entirely unacceptable in all walks of life; rugby’s challenge, beyond re-emphasising that fundamental message, is to apply this unity of spirit to other key areas as well.Leave aside, for now, the whole debate about the future structure of the global game and, ideally, finding a solution for the greater good. Instead, answer this simple question: what does rugby, ultimately, want to be? Does it wish to be seen as a collective beacon of fair play, integrity and honesty? Or would it prefer to remain in devil-take-the-hindmost territory, with more and more people blatantly out for whatever they can get? Increasingly it would appear these two aspirations are mutually exclusive.Take the salary cap, for example. There is insufficient space here to examine all the financial niceties but, basically, Premiership Rugby is examining whether assisted property investments entered into by several leading Saracens players are actually benefits in kind and, as such, should be included under salary cap regulations. The Saracens owner, Nigel Wray, without whom the club might still be playing on a public park in north London, says everything is above board. Some of those wondering how on earth Saracens have managed to stockpile so many top players under existing salary cap regulations beg to differ.The outcome, one way or another, will be instructive. Should Saracens be found guilty – to be clear, they deny any wrongdoing – it might restore some of the faith forfeited by the opaque nature of previous salary cap investigations. There are lower bands but for every pound above £200,000 a club is found to be over the salary cap, a fine of £3 can be levied. There could be points deductions as well, although that punishment would come under the microscope should Saracens have this season’s title tucked away before any potential guilty verdict is announced.While the Rugby Football Union works out what to do with Billy Vunipola – a stern warning, presumably, about his future social media activities – the wider game also has to ask how it proceeds in other vital areas. To see three Leicester players flying off their feet towards a vulnerable Newcastle’s Toby Flood at a ruck is to be reminded again just how vital it is for the authorities to enforce the existing laws at the breakdown for everyone’s safety. Anyone who witnessed the shoulder-led tackle by Joe Tekori that saw Clermont’s Yohan Beheregaray carried off on a stretcher against Toulouse on Sunday and earned only a yellow card will also be aware the consistency of sanctions for high tackles remains highly elusive.And, finally, what about George Ford’s entirely legal but dispiriting little act of gamesmanship on Friday, deliberately delaying his easy conversion attempt against Newcastle to try to run the clock down? Duncan Weir did something similar in the closing seconds for Worcester against the Tigers earlier in the season but this latest occurrence came in mid-match. To preserve the spirit of the game, it may soon be time to remove the 90-second maximum time available for a conversion and instead stop the clock. Do the same with scrums and a further avenue to cheat the system will be removed.Rugby’s moral maze, as it stands, has never been more complex. Israel Folau may have been misguided to post what he did but at least there was a semblance of honest conviction involved.Another week, another man of the match award for Danny Cipriani. There is a long way still to go but Gloucester are finishing the season as strongly as anyone and might not be easily shaken off by Saracens should the two clubs meet in a Premiership semi-final. Eddie Jones remains steadfastly of the opinion that Cipriani is not a key part of England’s World Cup plans but in the event of a Cherry and White grand final appearance and another Cipriani masterclass opposite Owen Farrell that stance will be increasingly tricky to justify.Two huge European semi-finals await for Leinster and Munster this weekend but this is a big week, too, for London Irish, who will be promoted back to the Premiership should they beat Richmond on Good Friday. Having won 18 and lost only two of their Championship games to date, it will be interesting to see how they fare next season. Should they find themselves back in the Championship when they move to their new shared stadium in Brentford in 2020, it will be a distinct anticlimax."},
{"title": "Jofra Archer can hit the target for England as World Cup beckons", "time": "Tue 16 Apr 2019 ", "category": "Cricket", "tags": "England cricket team,The Spin,Cricket,features", "content": "eadlines are not what they were, although there may be some harrumphing in the office if I don’t get this there on time. In the wider world there have been some high-profile failures to meet deadlines and life goes on. Meanwhile there is an ICC directive that requires each nation competing in the  World Cup to submit its preliminary squad by 23 April. But this is another soft deadline. Every country can make changes to its squad until 23 May. I suppose the system helps those who have to write player profiles of the 150 players who will be involved in the World Cup.Ed Smith will be announcing England’s preliminary squad of 15 on Wednesday as well as the names of two other players who will be involved in the games against Ireland and Pakistan that precede the World Cup. This will be his first significant act in a summer which holds such huge expectations for English cricket.The assumption is that everyone at the England and Wales Cricket Board is willing the side to victory – that is certainly the hope of The Spin – even though it may be mildly embarrassing in the wake of a thrilling England victory, which has captivated the nation, when the ECB confirms that the 50-over format of the game at which we excel has been relegated to development status. Our potential stars of the 2023 World Cup will not be playing any domestic 50-over cricket from 2020 onwards. Someone will be required to explain this state of affairs, a task no easier than justifying the poll tax (or, if I’m allowed to mention it, a no-deal Brexit – “Not to worry; it will all work out fine in the end. Just don’t ask me how”).The anticipation is that there will be one name announced by Smith which has never appeared on an international scorecard for England, Jofra Archer. He has only just qualified to play for England since settling here from Barbados. Chris Jordan, his teammate and close friend, recommended him to Sussex and it is now possible that Archer may overtake Jordan in the pecking order.Why is he so attractive to the selectors? Because he can be extraordinary. According to the CricViz database, he was the fastest bowler in county cricket last summer by a considerable margin. He is a brilliant fielder and has the capacity to hit the ball a long way. This winter he has excelled in the Big Bash and has had his moments in the IPL. So there is much to admire in the plus column. In the minus column is the notion that his late inclusion might disrupt the harmony of a very settled side … and he has never played an international match.The predicament with Archer has a couple of interesting parallels. Back in 1991 Graeme Hick qualified for England and the universal assumption was that he would dominate in Test cricket just as he had for Worcestershire. He was selected as soon as he was available but it never quite happened. By contrast it is easy to forget the debate about whether to give Kevin Pietersen a Test debut against Australia at Lord’s in 2005. At the start of that series the choice was between him and the stalwart Graham Thorpe. Of course, they opted for Pietersen and seven weeks later it seemed the obvious thing to do. It was not quite such a straightforward decision at the time.In 2019 the selectors will have a quick look at Archer in May and, following the Pietersen principle, if they like what they see, they will confirm him in the World Cup squad on 22 May. There is room for a wildcard in the squad. Bear in mind there is always scope for an injury replacement during the tournament, so it is necessary to have only one spare batsman, who is currently the formidable Alex Hales.By the same token England probably do not require another spinning all-rounder in their squad in addition to Moeen Ali, Adil Rashid and Joe Root. So there might be space for Archer alongside the usual band of pace bowlers. This would be sad news for the south coast hopefuls Joe Denly and Liam Dawson. However, it might suit Denly better to be scoring runs for Kent in the Championship than running around in a yellow bib for seven weeks during the World Cup, which has already been his lot during his stay in the IPL. Remember that Denly was in England’s last Test team and there are half a dozen county batsmen eyeing his place.Smith has been spied on the Championship circuit this spring and he will presumably spend more time there during the World Cup. It is early days but already some recent England players have posted big scores, albeit on surfaces that have not been as juicy as 12 months ago. Gary Ballance has been in the runs; so too has Dawid Malan. A source of greater excitement was the century by Haseeb Hameed at Lord’s after so long in the wilderness, though he has much consolidating to do. At least he is in the Lancashire side now.Of the non-internationals Sam Northeast has prospered for Hampshire. And in a week when the extramural activities of some of our young cricketers have not shown the game in a good light it might be worth the selectors looking at the merits of Somerset’s impressive captain, Tom Abell. He was not required by the Lions in the winter but must now be worth considering at that level. After two matches his teammate Lewis Gregory has taken 14 wickets at 10 apiece. And if Archer ever has the chance to hold a red ball again, he will be in contention for Test cricket as well. ."},

This horse hasn’t travelled anywhere, he’s only had the one start.“I’m pleased with what he’s done physically, his preparation’s gone well. He’s shown a good level of form on his only start but it’s a big step now. It’s a face-finding mission, really. We’re going there with confidence that we have a nice horse on our hands but to what level, we’re going there to find out.”Meanwhile, the Dewhurst runner-up will be back at Newmarket on Tuesday, albeit not for a race. Advertise is to have a spin up the track before racing starts. “His preparation has gone absolutely according to plan,” Martyn Meade tells me. “I think he’s stronger than he was last season. It’s a good thing to sharpen him up, to take him along and let him see the surroundings and let him have a potter along on the Rowley Mile, and then he can come home and we can put the finishing touches on him for the Guineas.“I can get him fit at home,” added Meade, who moved into Manton in Wiltshire just over a year ago. “It’s more a matter of waking him up a little bit, to think a big race is around the corner and things are happening. It’s about mental stimulation.”I’m surprised to see 14-1 available for  in the big race, the Nell Gwyn, and even more surprised to see she was 20-1 before getting Pricewised. I accept she’s not the most obvious possible winner but I thought she’d be value at half those odds.This is a filly I liked a lot last year, when she did well while suggesting she’d be considerably better again at three. A daughter of Kingman, she excelled on fast ground at Sandown in July and I don’t hold it against her that she failed to show her form at Goodwood, which many a fine horse has done before her.Importantly, Andrew Balding’s stable has been as hot as you could reasonably hope for in recent weeks. She gets her ground and I’m sure she’ll be ready.Otherwise, I’m leaning on the John Gosden crutch a bit. The chance of  is not hard to see in the Free Handicap, given that he chased home the subsequent Greenham winner when last seen, at this track. He’s 7-4.Half an hour later, the 5-2 shot  could give the stable a quick double in the Feilden. I think he has a lot more potential for improvement here than the Aidan O’Brien runner who is currently favourite, Western Australia. Aidan has never won this race and I’d be surprised if it was a particular ambition of his to do so. But the presence of this horse will give him an insight as to the value of the form.The 10-1 about isn’t bad for the sprint handicap. Richard Hannon’s runner will be sharper for his return to action at Doncaster last month and he showed promise before being gelded last year.There’s a  hotpot in the two-year-old race but she wears a hood, which is a potential sign of trouble, and the 10-1 about  is interesting, given that she is bred to be all about speed.

It was a rare fight for Ovechkin, one that knocked the 19-year-old Svechnikov from the game when he banged his helmet on the ice as he fell backward. Svechnikov, who had two goals in his playoff debut last week, was helped to the locker room and didn’t return. That left his status unclear for Thursday’s Game 4 and beyond with the Capitals up 2-1 in the best-of-seven series.Andrei Svechnikov gets into a fight with heavyweight, Alex Ovechkin, and is knocked out cold  “First of all I hope he’s OK,” Ovechkin said. “You’re right: I’m not a big fighter ... He asked me to fight, I said, ‘Let’s go, yeah.’ So, I hope he’s OK. You don’t want to see a guy get hurt or something.”It was Ovechkin’s fourth career fight and first since 2010, according to HockeyFights.com. It was his first in the playoffs, while Svechnikov had not been in a fight all season. Carolina coach Rod Brind’Amour didn’t have an update on his status. The team said only that Svechnikov had an upper-body injury.“How do you comment on it? It’s a little bit tough because I just heard Ovie talk about it: he said our guy challenged him,” Brind’Amour said. “If that’s the case, it’s a little different. But if you watch the video, because I got to watch it, he slashes him twice, Ovie whack, whack and then Svech gives it back. And then, I don’t know if there’s words exchanged, but one guy’s gloves come off way first. And that’s Ovie, it’s not our guy.”It was less than a year ago that Svechnikov got the chance to meet a player he had long looked up to before the Capitals closed their Cup run and before Svechnikov was the No2 overall pick in the draft. “It’s just an honor to have met with him,” Svechnikov said then of meeting Ovechkin.This time, things weren’t quite so friendly. Ovechkin with a 40lbs weight advantage locked a firm hold on Svechnikov’s collar while throwing a steady bombardment of punches. He eventually landed one squarely in the center of Svechnikov’s face. And as the rookie started falling backward, Ovechkin kept his hold and delivered a final blow toward Svechnikov’s forehead as they fell.As Ovechkin skated to the penalty box for a five-minute fighting penalty, Svechnikov was flat on his back, dazed and struggling to sit up as teammates Jordan Staal and Kevin Faulk skated to him. Svechnikov eventually was able to stand but was wobbly as he was helped off the ice.Brind’Amour said he was “still sick to my stomach about it.”“It’s a little bit frustrating, because he got hurt, it’s his first fight,” Brind’Amour said. “He’s played 90 games, he never fought in his life, I’m pretty sure Ovie knew that. So that stuff bothers me … but it’s done.”"},

Might England have actually won the game sooner without the dramatic finish, if it was the notoriously terrible tail-ender McGrath in on that final morning instead of Kasprowicz? Who knows, but for England supporters it does not bear thinking about.In the years after the first world war, women’s football was pulling crowds north of 50,000, with players such as Lily Parr and Bella Reay the stars of a burgeoning movement that looked as if it would run parallel to the men. But in 1921 the Football Association, showing the sort of forward-thinking and liberal attitudes it would stick by for years to come, decided the number of people flocking to watch the women could threaten the men, and that it simply was not on. It declared it was its “strong opinion the game of football is quite unsuitable for females and ought not to be encouraged”, and banned it from its grounds.A few clubs – most notably Dick, Kerr Ladies – soldiered on but most disbanded and the women’s game became disparate and uncoordinated, forced to play in parks, snuffed out by the most basic sexism.By the time the ban was lifted in 1971, the women’s game had 50 years to make up on the men, broadly explaining why it is still catching up in terms of popularity, funding and prominence, at a time when the men’s game is awash with money, attention and fame.

But during a tournament in Hamburg, shortly after Seles won the 1993 Australian Open, obsessed Graf fan Günter Parche invaded the court and plunged a knife into her back.The physical wounds healed fairly quickly but the psychological ones (combined with her father being diagnosed with terminal cancer) caused her to miss more than two years and 10 grand slam tournaments.

He has drifted to 9-4, however, after missing his much-anticipated return to action at Newbury.“There was heat in a splint bone which was why we couldn’t run [in the Greenham] and that was only six days ago,” Gosden said. “It’s improved a great deal at this stage and I think over the weekend, one’s got to be making a decision.“It’s not one of these things where you ‘umm’ and ‘ah’ and ‘if’ and ‘but’ up to the race, that’s not the way with a horse of this class and ability. By the time I get to that point after the weekend, I’ll know whether I’ve got a clean run-in or not, and then I’ll talk to the owners [Lord and Lady Lloyd Webber] and we’ll make a decision then.”Too Darn Hot was rated 126 in last season’s juvenile rankings, the highest mark since Frankel and Dream Ahead were given the same rating in 2010.“At the moment, it’s very much day-by-day,” Gosden said, “[and] he’s just on light exercise right now.

Those remarks make it difficult for Cheika to envision the 30-year-old being part of the Wallabies’ plans for the tournament in Japan, starting in September.“You wouldn’t be able to,” Cheika said when asked whether he could select Folau again under the circumstances.Cheika, Wallabies and NSW Waratahs captain Michael Hooper and Waratahs coach, Daryl Gibson all fronted the media in Sydney on Monday morning. Asked if he was comfortable taking the field again alongside Folau, flanker Hooper said: “In this current state and being here and talking about this as a rugby player, it makes it hard, it makes it difficult.”While emphasising what their teams stood for, especially in regards to diversity, they also stressed Folau was entitled to his beliefs. “Everybody has the right – and we respect that right – to believe whatever they like, we’re not moral judgers and no one should be,” Cheika said. “You take your friends warts and all, and your teammates,” Hooper said. “It’s frustrating having to stand here here because I can’t speak for Israel, but it is part of the team celebrating our diversity and celebrating that in a respectful manner.”Cheika conceded Folau had crossed a line which was marked when the religiously-motivated player made similar tweets a year ago. “Getting out in that disrespectful manner publicly is not what our team’s about,” Cheika said on Monday. “When you play in the gold jersey, we represent everyone in Australia – everyone. Everyone that’s out there supporting us.

His smile matches the two black eyes which make him look like a hardcore fighter during a brutal training camp. Of course this is the face of a professional rugby player who has won 72 caps for Ireland, played five Lions Tests and, after a magnificent nine-year career with Munster, is ready for a gripping European  semi-final against Saracens on Saturday.Murray turns 30 that day and he is entitled to joke about his age after he took a bang to the face . “Everybody makes a big deal of it,” he says of a milestone birthday. “It gives you a chance to reflect, see yourself as a 21-year-old, see where you thought you’d be, then look forward to where you want to go. I’ve been very lucky so turning 30 doesn’t scare me. I feel fit and I’m enjoying my rugby. Let’s not forget some lads play into their 40s.”The scrum-half laughs before his gaze turns steely. “I’m not going to do that but the next six-and-a-half months could be the best of my life. They could be career-defining.”The World Cup looms but, before then, Murray is consumed by Munster and  with his boyhood team. “It would be incredible,” Murray says. “I’ve been lucky with Lions tours and Six Nations wins and I wouldn’t trade them. But winning the European Cup with Munster would be unbelievable. It means the world to me.”When Murray made his Munster debut nine years ago this Thursday, was his fantasy to win the European Cup? “One hundred per cent. As a young fella, my thing was the Heineken Cup. Wow. I was there with my dad when . And I watched the 2008 final on the big screen in Limerick. There were tens of thousands and I was blown away. I also remember going into school after Munster lost semis and finals and people spoke about how they were crying at home. Munster and the European Cup is instilled in you. It means an awful lot here.”Before looking ahead to the ferocious clash with Saracens, Murray acknowledges that the past nine months have been the most testing of his brilliant career. He finished last season on a high. After helping Ireland to win the 2018 grand slam, Murray was at the heart of a historic series victory in Australia. His rugby was so consistently impressive that, in November, he won the French newspaper  award. Yet Murray was injured throughout the late summer and autumn. After choosing initially not to reveal any details, he was trailed by poisonous gossip which implied that Munster and Ireland might be hiding the results of a failed drugs test or a career-ending injury.When he returned in the Six Nations, Murray and Johnny Sexton, his half-back partner, were held up as prime examples of why Ireland failed to reach heightened expectations. A shattering  on the first weekend was echoed by  in their final game. Murray’s form came under unprecedented scrutiny.In contrast to the hysterical rumours that surrounded Murray’s absence, his injury was sparked by an innocuous hiccup. “I took a few bangs against Australia [in the deciding Test last June]. I was a bit sore the next day but nothing that would ring alarm bells. We went to the States, came home and I was fine driving to a wedding. But I had hiccups and felt a muscle go, like a tear. I thought: ‘Gee that’s sore.’ But it died down, I went to the wedding and played golf the next day. Then the second morning I woke up and couldn’t move. My neck was in spasm. The physios agreed the disc was on the edge of slipping and maybe the hiccup shifted it.”Uncertainty surrounded the injury and Murray decided that “I didn’t want to release anything”. He says: “It was my decision because the medical staff didn’t know how long it would last or what needed to be done. In that window there’s a void and people fill it with gossip. But as long as my family and I, my coaches and teammates, knew exactly what was going on, I was fine.“It’s the right of the player to withhold whatever he wants but I now think there’s a responsibility, especially at , where rugby means so much. I know how much the season ticket holders pay, so they deserve to know when players will be back.”When did he hear the wildest rumours? “In that three-week void. WhatsApp groups flicked them all over the country. Even my friends in London or abroad heard rumours and sent them to me. Steroids, a failed drug test or the injury’s so terrible he’s retiring.”Has it made him more cynical? “Yeah. You have to wonder why people are asking certain questions. But it’s good to be more careful.”It was hard for Murray to watch Ireland beat the All Blacks in November. “It’s difficult to describe, as a player who could have been involved. It’s horrible. Of course when Jacob [Stockdale] scored, the fan in me was like: ‘Oh my God, what a finish!’ But after the game, watching the lads walking around, I thought: ‘I’d love to be there.’ It’s tough.”Obviously I would love to have won a few more things at Munster but I’ve got time – starting on SaturdayAmid the understandable Irish euphoria, it seemed as if Ireland were the best team in the world. “We were – but it changes so fast. We had an incredible year and lost only one game. But look at England [in 2016]. They won their grand slam, went to Australia and won the series 3-0. Last year they finished fifth in the . But they bounced back and have a really good side again.”How did Murray feel the night before they faced England? “Really good. We had trained well, and were very clear in our plan. We were just a bit flat in the warm-up and conceded two early tries. Suddenly, you’re chasing the game. Wales was similar. We made a bad start. I spoke to Jonathan Davies [the Welsh centre] and he told me: ‘After the first 10 minutes we said we don’t need to play any more rugby. Let Ireland force it.’ It was a difficult day.”Murray looks determined as he moves beyond these disappointments. “The Six Nations hurt me and the team but we’re mentally strong enough to bounce back. No panic buttons are being pressed even if people want to make it a big thing. We know how good we are. We’ve won 23 out of 26 internationals and the media and public expect us to be at that peak all the time. It’s a compliment because when we are not at that level people panic and say: ‘Is your neck OK?’ I wish I could blame my neck but it had nothing to do with it.”His  to the point where over-analysis obscured the truth that he was simply returning from a long lay‑off. “Over‑analysis is the word. The media often focus on me and Johnny and we got some heat. But you’re never as good or as bad as they make you out to be. The difference between clicking and not clicking is maybe one pass or one ruck that goes wrong. It’s small skills but, in the bigger picture, it’s the difference between a really good or an average international performance. I suppose this Six Nations was the first time Johnny and I suffered a negative twist. But we’re wise enough not to be bothered by it.”Murray and Sexton, who are good friends, cope with a wearying level of fame in Ireland. “I was 22 at my first World Cup in 2011. I just enjoyed it but after the quarter‑finals, at the airport, Brian O’Driscoll said: ‘Enjoy your new‑found fame – it’s different.’ I was like: ‘What?’ When I came home, I understood. People were noticing me and that took a while to get used to. Some people enjoy it but I don’t really like the attention. You learn to deal with it and, at least in Munster, people just want to talk about rugby.”He lights up at the prospect of playing Saracens. “I’m really excited and it is a hugely tough game. I missed the semi-final two years ago [which Saracens won] and we got it wrong tactically. We also talk about the semi against Racing last year [which Munster also lost]. There have been six semi-final losses since Munster won it. It’s heartbreaking. That’s what we’ve got to manage this week – because being too emotional is draining.“Maybe a couple of times, we’ve gone: ‘Oh, my God, we’re in a semi, we need to do this or that.’ We now know to stick with what got us this far. Let the lads be comfortable the way they’re playing. Just train well, have a plan, enjoy it, and give our all. Don’t overthink. I can’t wait. It’s away but there will be more Munster fans. I’ll put my mortgage on it.”Murray knows many of the Saracens players after the British & Irish Lions tour of New Zealand in 2017. “There’s , Maro Itoje, Jamie George, who I’m quite friendly with. He’s a great guy. Great player. Owen, especially, is top class. He’s so good at making the right decision. Against Saracens you have to be aware of their kicking game, their line speed, their big ball carriers. Physically, you have to stand up to Itoje and the Vunipolas.”After , Murray felt the strongest he has done since his injury. “It was my most physical game of the year in terms of tackles and rucks. It’s a massive step in the right direction.”In a week which marks the start of his 10th year as a pro, and the end of his 20s, Murray sounds fulfilled. “I’m really happy how I’ve grown on and off the field. I have learnt lots of new skills as a player and a person. I also appreciate how lucky I am. I’ve always been conscious of older players saying it all went too quickly. So I make sure I enjoy everything. I love training, I love being with the lads. We’ve made lots of memories and I let the achievements soak in. In terms of regrets, I don’t have many. Obviously I would love to have won a few more things at Munster but I’ve got time – starting on Saturday.”Murray’s black eyes crinkle in anticipation. “That’s far more important than me turning 30.”"},
{"title": "Seahawks make Russell Wilson NFL's highest-paid player with $140m deal", "time": "Tue 16 Apr 2019 ", "category": "NFL", "tags": "Seattle Seahawks,NFL,US sports,news", "content": "Russell Wilson is sticking around with the  as the highest paid player in the NFL. Wilson posted a video on Twitter on Tuesday morning saying, “Seattle, we got a deal”. His agent, Mark Rodgers, said the deal is a $140m, four-year extension with the Seahawks. Wilson’s new contract runs through the 2023 season and includes a $65m signing bonus, a no-trade clause and $107m in guaranteed money.SEATTLE. Let’s get it.   Wilson’s per year average of $35m tops Aaron Rodgers’ average annual salary of $33.5m as part of the $134m extension . Wilson’s current $87.6m, four-year deal was signed at the beginning of training camp in 2015 and was set to expire after next season.“Russell’s goal and his hope was that he would continue his career with the Seahawks and continue to bring championships to this town,” Mark Rodgers, said. “He believes there is still unfinished business and he is looking forward to pursuing that without having to worry about contracts and his future.”The 30-year-old Wilson had set a midnight deadline for a new deal with Seattle. He wanted certainty about his contract before the start of the team’s offseason workout program, which began on Monday. Wilson showed up for the first day and by the end of the night was posting a video with wife Ciara announcing the agreement.The deal ends the debate about Wilson’s future with the Seahawks, although there seemed to be little doubt he would remain in Seattle for a while. The team held leverage knowing it likely had at least three more seasons with Wilson under center. Even if he played out 2019 under his current deal, Seattle could have used the franchise tag if needed to keep him under contract through 2020 and 2021 at a reasonable price by quarterback standards. But the extension allows Seattle to budget for the future knowing how to work with Wilson’s hefty paycheck in the years ahead and build a contender around the former third-round pick that has developed into a franchise QB.Wilson’s new deal was going to have to top the extension signed by Rodgers before the start of last season. Wilson was the second-highest paid player in football behind Rodgers when his deal was signed in 2015, but had fallen to the 12th highest-paid QB in the league, according to Overthecap.com.The five-time Pro Bowl selection is coming off arguably his best season as Seattle went a surprising 10-6 and earned an NFC wild card before losing to Dallas in the opening round of the playoffs. It was supposed to be a rebuilding year, but  thanks to their return to a run-first offense and Wilson’s exceptional performance when tasked to throw.Wilson threw for a career-high 35 touchdowns and matched his career low with seven interceptions. He attempted only 427 passes, his lowest total since his second season when Seattle won the Super Bowl, but his efficiency was a career best with a 110.9 passer rating. He also ran only 67 times, a career low, as the improved run game and offensive line play allowed Wilson to stay in the pocket more and scramble for his life less.It was a stark change from the 2017 season when Seattle missed the playoffs for the first time under Wilson. He led the league in touchdown passes, but also was Seattle’s leading rusher due to a non-existent run game.The idea of Wilson ever leaving Seattle has always seemed a stretch. Teams simply don’t give up on quarterbacks with the kind of success he’s had. Wilson has led the Seahawks to the playoffs in six of his seven seasons, the only miss coming in 2017 when Seattle finished 9-7. He won a Super Bowl in his second season and got back to the championship game a year later before making the one major mistake of his career that will linger until he wins another title, throwing a goal line interception in the final minute when the Seahawks had a chance to take the lead on New England. The 5ft 11in Wilson has shelved  being unable to play in the NFL. He’s also been extremely durable, never missing a game while playing through significant knee, ankle and shoulder injuries."},

A number of people in the LGBT community are vulnerable because of the discrimination they have had to face. Reading what was put up last week is harmful enough, but it is far worse when it comes from top stars who are well-paid ambassadors for the sport.”Folau had form after a similar outburst last year earned him a warning from Rugby Australia. The 30-year old included homosexuals among his list of “sinners”, but in 2014 he had helped promote the Bingham Cup, the biennial world championship of gay and inclusive rugby, which that year was held in Sydney.“Folau was on the front of the best known gay magazine in Australia promoting the cup,” Owen said. “It was a big surprise when he came out with his remarks last year. He may have been expressing his beliefs, but posts can have consequences. It was only last November that Gareth Thomas [the former Wales captain] was  because of his homosexuality.“The rugby world reacted brilliantly then with 10 international teams wearing rainbow laces that weekend in solidarity with him. Last week’s posts may not have been advocating violence but because they came from such high-profile players, their words could have led to intolerance.“A number of people who come to our clubs have, at some point, contemplated suicide because of the discrimination they have faced. Rugby offers them a family, a sense of belonging where people accept you for who you are. That is why last week was so hugely damaging.“Over the last five years, IGR and World Rugby have worked together with unions and clubs across the globe to ensure that our sport is for everyone. We have a very clear set of values that celebrate diversity, understanding and inclusiveness. It’s up to everyone involved in rugby, whether a spectator, player or a coach to promote these values, on and off the field. Even more so for those members of our community who have influence.”"},

{"title": "Ukraine’s lightweight, Vasiliy Lomachenko gave a display of punching perfection in beating Manchester’s Anthony Crolla to underline his claim to wear boxing’s pound-for-pound crown", "time": "Mon 15 Apr 2019 ", "category": "Boxing", "tags": "Boxing,Sportblog,comment", "content": "asiliy Lomachenko is making a rock-solid case to be regarded as the best boxer in the world, the pound-for-pound crown that can start a thousand arguments. There would be little or no dissent, however, from Anthony Crolla, whom the peerless  and who is now seriously considering retirement. “He’s as good as what they say, a fantastic fighter,” the 32-year-old Mancunian said through swollen lips.The biggest blow Crolla has taken in his life was a concrete slab thrown at the side of his head by an intruder he chased from a neighbour’s back garden in 2014. “You’ll never box again,” his doctor said that Christmas. He did – and Friday’s fight was the ninth since that night. Was it his last? The left hook in round four, followed by a right to the temple that pitched him face first on to the canvas, looked very much like the full stop to a slow-burning career over 13 years in which the universally admired Mancunian won 34 of 44 bouts, a world title and made some decent money.“I’ve banged on about staying in boxing too long,” he told Sky Sports. “I love this sport, it’s a big part of my life, but I’ve not got much longer left. I don’t want to go out like that but the end is near.”It was a challenge beyond his control from the first minute of the fight. Every facet of the champion’s arsenal clicked instantly in front of a capacity crowd at the Staples Center as he calmly and brutally defended his WBA and WBO lightweight titles against a mandated opponent who could not have prepared more diligently.Crolla discovered quickly what he had suspected, what everybody in boxing knew: Lomachenko is a master of space and timing, pulling him this way and that with feints and sublime footwork. He hits with precision and full force. He is impossibly difficult to measure for a counter. He is, in short, the complete fighter.As Darren Barker said ringside: “Timing can’t be taught, it comes naturally. And the punch variation was exceptional. That was punch-perfect. He made a real statement there. He’s shown why he’s arguably the No 1 fighter out there. He’s just got it all. I do not seem him getting beaten again.”Crolla said before the fight: “Lomachenko is a hell of a fighter. I would say he’s the best on the planet at doing what he does. But no man’s invincible.” On Friday night – and many others – he was just that and will remain so until someone even more exceptional emerges.The manner of the finish was chilling. After two lopsided rounds there was confusion towards the end of the third when the referee, Jack Reiss (whose 116-113 score in favour of Orlando Salido handed Lomachenko his only defeat in his second paid fight, six years ago) gave Crolla a standing eight count, ruling the ropes had prevented his going down under a barrage of head shots. It only postponed the inevitable.When they resumed, Crolla, still dazed, was decked face first for a full count by a left hook and a finishing crisp right to the temple. He rose in bloodied confusion, protesting to the ringside doctor: “I’m fine.” He was about as far from “fine” as it is possible to get in a boxing ring.“No one’s done that to Anthony Crolla,” Spencer Oliver observed.Lomachenko is so dominant the most credible opponent left for him at lightweight is Mikey Garcia, who lost last time out when he moved up two divisions to welterweight, where  as completely as he did Kell Brook.“Mikey Garcia. I dunno,” Lomachenko said in the ring. “I’ll stay at 135 for as long as possible, to unify all the titles.” Garcia still holds the WBC belt and Richard Commey is the IBF champion. Lomachenko would start a strong favourite to beat both of them.As Crolla’s trainer, Joe Gallagher, remarked beforehand, Lomachenko does not just beat opponents, he embarrasses them. He has mastered all styles of opponent and, in an astonishing run between November 2016 and December 2017 he forced four quality challengers – Nicholas Walters, Jason Sosa, Miguel Marriaga and Guillermo Rigondeaux – to quit. They had only three defeats between them in 88 contests.Walters, once a feared two-division champion, has not fought in the two years since and, at 32, is a marginal figure; Sosa has lost one and drawn two; Marriaga has won twice against journeymen; Rigondeaux, at 38, knocked out 16-8 trialhorse Giovanni Delgado in his only fight since losing to Lomachenko in December 2017. That is what he does to good fighters. He shortens careers.Lomachenko is not a big lightweight, having moved up from featherweight to super-feather then 135lbs in a whirlwind 14-fight professional career after a long, glorious reign as the best amateur in boxing. At 31, lightweight looks to be where he will settle for the rest of his fighting days although the lack of credible challengers may tempt him to see what he can do elsewhere. There may even be a catchweight showdown with Manny Pacquiao – and that would bring him face to face with his chief inquisitor, Freddie Roach, reunited with the Pacman after a mysterious split.The former trainer of the year has taken some convincing Lomachenko is the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world. Before Friday’s bout he reckoned two compatriots, Terrence Crawford and Spence, were ahead of the Ukrainian in that category, sayinginsisting: “Lomachenko is beatable.” You could almost hear the Stars and Stripes fluttering in the background.Roach dislikes what he calls Lomachenko’s “clown behaviour”. But he got it way wrong when he predicted aging genius Rigondeaux would stop him. The excellent Cuban was as demoralised as all the others. Roach also thinks Garcia could beat Lomachenko.However, after Lomachenko’s demolition of Crolla, Roach softened his criticism. “He looked really good tonight,” he said. “I love when he’s serious like that. When he’s like that he can beat anyone in the world.” And he concedes Lomachenko would beat the rising Honduran knockout star, Teófimo López. “He’s a more complete fighter.”The rest of the industry seem convinced. Carl Frampton was moved to tweet: “When people get asked who their favourite fighter of all time is? You hear the usual names. Ali, Tyson, Leonard, Hagler, Duran, Chavez etc. Are we allowed to say Lomachenko yet? Cause I think hes mine.”Crolla has long called himself “Million Dollar”; Lomachenko’s gown is embroidered with “Billionaire Loma”. It pretty much described the gap between Lomachenko and his doomed foe – as well as everyone else.Right now Loma is invincible."},
{"title": "Talking Horses: Connor Brace is latest promising jump jockey from Wales", "time": "Mon 15 Apr 2019 ", "category": "Racing", "tags": "Horse racing tips,Talking Horses,Horse racing,features", "content": "We will hear more from Connor Brace, picked by Nicky Henderson to claim 7lb off Verdana Blue in Saturday’s Scottish Champion Hurdle, which the pair won handsomely. The way that she bolted up suggests that an awful lot of other jockeys could have won on her, but it was interesting that Henderson was prepared to trust a 17-year-old rookie with such a mission and I thought Brace handled it extremely well, for someone who got his conditionals’ licence in September.“It was great to get on a very nice horse like her,” Brace told me on Sunday. “We went a good gallop and she just jumped and travelled the whole way round. We’ve turned in and as soon as I’ve given her a squeeze, she’s taken off with me. I was hoping that’s how it was going to happen. She was the best in the race and showed it.”Born and raised in Porthcawl, Brace’s introduction to racing came from his grandfather, David Brace, a trainer in Bridgend who founded Dunraven Stud, where Ask stands. “He’s got nine grandchildren but there’s only me who’s interested in horses,” Brace says. The others might have to rethink their life choices now. “Since I was five or six, I was mad to ride ponies and go racing.”While he eventually rode in point to points for his grandfather, Brace is a product of pony racing, in which sphere he often bumped up against other talented young jockeys from Wales, James and Sean Bowen and Lorcan Williams. Pony racing barely existed in Britain as recently as 15 years ago but there’s a fair bit of it about now and I submit that we’re seeing the benefit in the quality of young jockeys entering the game.Brace is based at Naunton with Fergal O’Brien, having been spotted by the trainer’s assistant, Sally Randell, when he beat one of Fergal’s in a point to point last year.Having reported increased viewing figures for the Cheltenham Festival and the Grand National, ITV report that their audience was also up for Saturday’s Scottish Grand National. The peak of 1.18m was up 17% on last year, while the average of 673,000 was also up 10%.Windsor is the card that’s drawn my attention, not least because of the presence of , presumably named by a Phil Collins fan and a 7-2 shot for a mile handicap. There are some unexposed rivals in opposition but a good number of them will be sharper for this return, whereas Run After Genesis is already a winner this year, having scored on his handicap debut last month.That was the grey’s handicap debut and the way he stayed on suggests he will appreciate the additional test of another furlong and a switch to fast turf. It was a bunch finish but the second and third have since made the form look pretty good.If you play at short prices,  makes appeal, even at 4-5, for Archie Watson, who does so well with zippy youngsters. In the opening sprint handicap,  is of interest at 8-1, from 12s, having done well on fast turf as a three-year-old. She’ll be sharper for her comeback run.An hour later, I might have an each-way pot shot on , a drifter out to 33-1. It’s interesting that he’s back with David Evans, having done well for him years ago before moving through other yards and gradually losing his form.

And . This looks as if it will be a new reality for Billy Vunipola, which may or may not come to affect his game over the coming weeks. He has always come across as something of a happy-go-lucky guy but the No 8 will need the ruthless focus of his England teammate Owen Farrell if recent events and any future repercussions are not to distract him from his day job. One other point did muscle its way into the talking – and that was the kicking. As if chastened by their profligacy the week before, Bristol kicked and kicked and kicked. As did Saracens. This was a trip back to the bad old days in more ways than one. There is an argument that, in terms of consistent quality, this has not been a vintage Premiership season: three of the league’s top four sides were beaten at the weekend and with three regular-season games left, just 10 points separate the fifth-placed team from the club in 11th. No one could ever accuse the  of being dull, however, with Wasps’ first away win at Sandy Park in 10 attempts not remotely on the cards when they trailed 12-0 after half an hour. It further underlines the growing importance of momentum in top-level rugby; once Exeter lost their grip – as with England against Scotland last month – they struggled to find a way back. Wasps fully deserved this success but the real challenge will be backing it up against Saracens on Saturday week.  are two points away from their first play-off appearance for eight years, closer to Saracens in second than they are to Harlequins in fourth. Only Northampton could thwart the Cherry and Whites who have gained consistency under Johan Ackermann. The win against Bath was their sixth in seven league games, and they overcame an early 17-point deficit to clinch the match in the final quarter. They have more sinew at forward through Franco Mostert and Jaco Kriel, backed up by Ed Slater and Ruan Ackermann, while Ben Morgan is rolling back the years at No 8. Another difference is Danny Cipriani, the master of invention who pickpockets defenders. He has become more patient with age, waiting for his moment rather than forcing it. A trip to Saracens beckons in the play-offs, not Cipriani’s favourite ground but at least he will have a proper pack in front of him. Northampton’s last-gasp victory at Harlequins was not only a testament to perseverance but to faith in youth demonstrated by the director of rugby, Chris Boyd. The try-scoring hero was Alex Mitchell, 21, while the conversion was slotted by James Grayson, 20. On top of that James Fish, Lewis Ludlam, George Furbank, Rory Hutchinson and Fraser Dingwall – all of whom are 23 or younger – have seen plenty of game time this season. A lot of those are backs and prospering under the tutelage of the attack coach, Sam Vesty. “He has been great,” Mitchell said. “He doesn’t just tell us to chuck the ball around but to play how we want to play. We are all natural rugby players, we just want to play what we see. He is great at pushing that forward.” Heaven knows Leicester have learned to lower their sights in recent times but rarely has a victory meant so much. The Tigers, awful for so much of this season,  in the closing stages with Newcastle camped on their line. Guy Thompson, whose delightful assist for Jonny May’s opener and second-half double laid the platform for victory, won a vital turnover at the end to confirm the win. The Leicester playmaker George Ford was honest enough to admit that “the feeling is one of relief rather than happiness I’m really proud of the boys for the fight we showed at the end when it could have gone either way.” With three games remaining, Newcastle are seven points adrift of safety and relegation would spark a likely exodus of key men like Mark Wilson and possibly even Dean Richards, the director of rugby. A thumping win for Worcester has all but sealed their safety with Newcastle now seven points below them at the foot of the table. On Saturday Josh Adams helped himself to a hat-trick against a Sale side seemingly intent on proving right their director of rugby, Steve Diamond, who insisted last week that they were not good enough for the top four. Adams will be missed when he heads back to Wales next season, having scored 38 tries in 62 appearances for . Another wing Bryce Heem is also off in the summer and he, too, will be hard to replace at Sixways. It may feel premature in the extreme to start thinking about Worcester’s survival prospects for next season but it will not get any easier considering the amount of money London Irish have been spending. Freddie Burns kicked a drop goal on the turn to extend Bath’s lead at Gloucester on the hour, then limped off. Within a minute, the home side took the lead for the first time and held on. The fly-half, making his first start for more than four months, was forced off by compartment syndrome, something he has battled throughout his career. “It causes my calves to cramp up,” he said. “I have tried everything but nothing has worked.” Conor O’Shea’s contract with Italy runs until after next year’s Six Nations but the Pro14 side the Cheetahs claim their coach, Franco Smith, has been offered the job from next January. The former South Africa fly-half, who won nine caps, finished his playing career in Italy in 2006 and his second coaching job was with Treviso, where he spent six years. Guy Thompson has been one of the few  players to live up to reputation this season. Playing out of position at No 8 on Friday night in the crucial relegation battle at Newcastle, he scored two tries and set up the opener for May on the right wing with a timely appearance in the line and a defence-killing pass out of the back of his hand. The England wing made no mistake as the Tigers eased their relegation fears for the moment at least. 15   14   13  12  11 10   9  1  2  3  4   5  6  7   8  "},

But then, on Sunday, came a miracle", "time": "Mon 15 Apr 2019 ", "category": "Golf", "tags": "Golf,Tiger Woods,Donald Trump,US sports,comment", "content": "rotesque, malevolent and a cheat at golf: does Auric Goldfinger remind you of anyone? And there’s the obsession with gold. Goldfinger’s Rolls-Royce is panelled in solid gold and he kills a woman by having her covered with gold paint. Donald Trump’s use of gold is a little less original, more symbolic than functional: it’s the colour, for instance, of Trump Tower in Las Vegas, gleaming like a huge gold brick standing on its end above the neon-lit Strip.But it’s the cheating at golf that concerns us here. One of the most beguiling of Bond villains, Goldfinger is first encountered rigging a game of two-handed canasta by the pool at a Miami hotel. When he next encounters 007, it is at Royal St Mark’s on the Kent coast, a thinly disguised Royal St George’s. They agree to play a round for money: double or quits for the $10,000 Bond took off Goldfinger in Florida.The original version, in Ian Fleming’s book, is a gripping shot-by-shot account of a game during which Bond observes his adversary’s various underhand ploys. Goldfinger lets his shadow fall across his opponent’s teed-up ball and jiggles coins in his pocket just as Bond is about to play. He jumps up in a bunker, ostensibly to get a better view over the lip but actually to improve his lie in the sand. And when his ball is lost in the deep rough, he bribes his caddy to drop another one in a better position. Fleming knew golf well, and although he was writing 60 years ago, when players would pull a spoon or a niblick out of their bag rather than a fairway wood or a nine-iron, there is nothing dated about Bond’s cleverly planned revenge.In the 1964 film, Goldfinger is played by Gert Fröbe, a wide-bodied German actor who – as well as getting the best line in any Bond film (“No, Mr Bond, I expect you to die!”) – conveys a familiar combination of vast entitlement and vindictive paranoia. Watching it the other night, in the middle of , it was possible to imagine that repeated viewings of the film at an impressionable age inspired his approach to life as well as golf. If golf explains Trump, then so does Goldfinger.The author of the new book is Rick Reilly, a former Sports Illustrated columnist justly celebrated for his wit. He first met Trump 30 years ago, in the days when the ambitious young developer liked being photographed with celebrities at Studio 54. Reilly was writing a book about caddying for famous people, and Trump readily accepted an invitation to be one of his subjects. The way it worked out, Reilly ended up not carrying Trump’s bag but playing against him. His opponent’s curious approach to the rules got him interested in Trump’s behaviour, and his book is a veritable encyclopedia of improved lies, phantom chip-ins, balls mystifyingly found in unlikely landing spots, and other gross but unpenalised offences against the game’s ethics. It’s horrible, of course, but you can only laugh as when you learn that at all his golf resorts Trump keeps his own personalised buggy, each of them turbocharged to allow him to whizz up the fairways, getting ahead of his opponents’ slower vehicles so that they can’t see what he’s getting up to with his ball – and sometimes with theirs, which they might discover in a surprisingly unfavourable location.When Reilly forensically debunks Trump’s frequent claim to have won “18 club championships”, he connects the falsehood to a pattern of behaviour. Tell ’em you’re 6ft 3in when you’re actually six-one. Tell ’em something that cost $20m cost $50m. Tell ’em that a 58-storey highrise has 68 floors (with nothing at all between the 20th, where the business levels end, and what you’ll call the 30th, where the apartments start). Tell ’em that a column of economic migrants heading for the US border contains terrorists and drug dealers.And he has one story that sums up the whole phenomenon. The first time they played a round together, Trump introduced Reilly to several acquaintances. Except he was not introduced as a columnist for Sports Illustrated. It was as “the president of Sports Illustrated” or “ the publisher of Sports Illustrated”. Eventually Reilly asked him why he was doing this. “Sounds better,” Trump replied. For anyone compiling a list of Things That Explain Everything, Donald Trump’s “Sounds better” should be pretty close to the top. follow us at  like our  and  pages our favourite  subscribe to our  and  channelsThe president’s very public addiction to golf represents everything that makes a very good game easy to dislike, while coinciding with a troubling downturn in its popularity. But then, on Sunday, came a miracle. For anyone who watched the final round of the Masters, it will be impossible to forget the face of unremitting concentration that  brought to the back nine. Where this used to be a mask, now it was the look of a man who had glimpsed redemption and was not going to let anything, least of all his own ego, spoil his chance of grasping it. On an individual level, it was extremely moving. Four bogeys in the round kept his achievement on a human scale, his acceptance of it was humble, and his celebration seemed like a genuine release of emotion. For the game as a whole, it was a blast of cleansing fluid that removed all sorts of stains. And if anyone writes a better golf book this year than Rick Reilly’s Commander in Cheat, it will probably be titled How Tiger Saved Golf from Trump."},

{"title": "The difference between the way Americans regard athletes versus “intellectuals” is a touchstone for how we see ourselves", "time": "Mon 15 Apr 2019 ", "category": "US sports", "tags": "US sports,comment", "content": "n 19 April 1980, more than 50,000 Parisians marched through the streets to mourn the loss of one of their own. Was it for a famous pop star, a beloved politician or a nationally treasured athlete? Nope, it was the funeral of Jean-Paul Sartre, the French existential philosopher and winner of the Nobel prize in literature (which he refused, along with the $500,000 prize money, out of concern it would compromise his independent thinking). In America, that mass public display of grief and affection is usually reserved for pop culture icons, not unapologetic intellectuals. Maybe it’s time to rethink that priority.I can’t imagine the death of an American philosopher or literary writer drawing such a large crowd. But we do turn out for our fallen sports heroes:  and . Both well deserved. On the other hand, how many attended the 1996 funeral of equally deserving American poet laureate Joseph Brodsky, an immigrant who won the Nobel prize in literature in 1987? I don’t know the answer because the information isn’t even available. Can most of us even name a single contemporary American philosopher or influential literary author with the ease we can a Kardashian? If the answer is no, our initial reaction should be a slight sense of shame (and maybe a quick Google search), but more likely it would be to scoff and dismiss the question with a smug “Who cares?” But this instant dismissal really reflects a troubling trend of lazy and arrogant anti-intellectualism that has very real and dangerous consequences to American society.The difference between the way Americans regard athletes versus “intellectuals” is a good touchstone for how we see ourselves. One statistic showed 93% , while another concludes that about 60% of . Count me in. I’m grateful for America’s love of sports, a love I share as a major fan of baseball and basketball. Sports have become ingrained in our society as a means of activity for personal health and as an educational tool to teach moral values such as sportsmanship, discipline and teamwork. Even more significant, athletes are . While that places a lot of pressure on athletes, some of whom are still very young themselves, many others have stepped up to accept that responsibility.At the same time we’re increasingly embracing sports, the last few years have produced a rising anti-intellectualism, starting with facts, science and logic. Anti-vaxxers, climate change deniers, even flat-earthers are on the rise. Part of the reason for this is the promotion of fuzzy thinking as a positive political statement. All those people who were told in school that their opinions lack any meaningful support and are filled with logical fallacies can now band together in shared ignorance masquerading as conservative ethos. They get to thumb their noses at the “elite” thinkers.President Trump is the figurehead of celebrating irrational thinking as a patriotic act. He’s the rabble rouser in the saloon whipping the mob into a lynching frenzy. Every time there’s a snow storm, he comments about this being proof that there is no global warming. And he keeps doing this despite the scientific experts explaining that there is a vast difference between weather and climate. Just as  show a fundamental lack of understanding about what that even means. And there’s his absolution of the crimes of Russia’s Vladimir Putin, North Korea’s Kim Jong-un and Saudi Arabia’s Mohammed bin Salman, despite the evidence put forth by his own intelligence experts. This kind of convoluted thinking has led to the dismantling of EPA protections, attacks on voter access and open political corruption without consequences. The lesson for our children: ignore facts and evidence if it disagrees with what benefits you personally. Even if it means everyone else will suffer. Ironically, that’s the opposite lesson that sports teach about sacrificing for the good of the team.That’s the philosophy of the anti-vaxxers, who have justified their silliness through junk science and discredited physicians. Suddenly, they know more than the scientists who have been researching it for years, more than the statistics that show measles having been nearly wiped out until they started allowing it to spread. Measles is now on the rise, killing people across the world. Doctors claim that if the current trend continues, 2019 could produce the worst measles outbreak in the US in decades. What is their criteria for when to reject or embrace doctors? Are they leaning over the surgeon’s shoulders during brain surgery on loved ones advising what to do next?We should have a healthy attitude of skepticism regarding experts because they have not always been proven right. But skepticism isn’t the same as believing nutty conspiracy theories. Skepticism means requiring evidence through scientific method (something that ushered in the Enlightenment). Instead, we even have what psychologists call the Dunning-Kruger Effect, in which people of low knowledge have the illusion that their opinions are superior to those of experts. They like to tout their innate “common sense”, which throughout history has been proven to be the worst kind of sense. Worse, because they eschew logic, politicians have targeted them with a constant barrage of emotional gobbledygook reasoning to pump up their egos without challenging their minds. They are led around by the nose, voting how they are told but thinking they are independent.A culture can admire both the physical and intellectual. The achievements of athletes inspire us to push the boundaries of what our bodies are capable of. We can run faster, jump higher, endure more punishment than we thought. That makes us all realize we have untapped potential. Equally, we can be inspired by the insights of our poets, the vision of our philosophers, the medical breakthroughs of our scientists. Both should make us strive to be greater: stronger and smarter. The problem is that when the average person sees an athlete perform an amazing feat, there’s the lurking belief that, if they really wanted to train and practice, they could do it, too. It is within their grasp. But with intellectual feats, some people see that as beyond their understanding and therefore beyond their reach. Rather than strive, they resent. It’s easier to look up baseball stats than read an article on melting ice caps. Plus, there’s an implied pressure to the latter: if I accept that something is wrong, am I not obligated to do something about it? It’s easier to deny, deny, deny. Like those “common sense” citizens who loudly decried the existence of germs, the benefits of penicillin, or the evidence of DNA, such anti-intellectualism leads to sickness, death and the hobbling of a society’s progress.Intellectuals don’t help their cause when they are dismissive of pop culture and sports, by demeaning their great achievements. Neither high culture nor pop culture are a measure of intelligence, just of past exposure. Any attempt to use either as a means to imply superiority demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of what art strives to do: bring us closer together by showing that we are all equal in our needs to love, be loved, and strive to be better tomorrow than we are today. We accomplish this by understanding that the elegant idea is as uplifting as the slam dunk. And that a triple play is as graceful as a balletic arabesque. To disparage either the athlete or the intellect indicates someone not worthy of either."},
{"title": "A cricket coaching revolution is under way in Sussex – just press play", "time": "Mon 15 Apr 2019 ", "category": "Cricket", "tags": "Sussex,Cricket,features", "content": "n the indoor school at Hove a young Zimbabwean called Tawanda Muyeye is batting against three of Sussex’s best young spinners, Jack Carson, Will Collard and Abdullah Nazir. Their coach, Richard Halsall, is at the bowler’s end with a tablet in one hand. It is linked to a camera above his head, and a couple of big TV screens on one wall. Halsall is tagging every delivery, noting whether Muyeye middled each shot or not. The clips are immediately uploaded to an app Halsall has designed, which means that seconds later Sussex’s batting coach, Muyeye’s school coach, and his parents will all be able to watch the footage on their phones, and see for themselves how well he is playing today.Halsall took over as Sussex’s academy director last summer. He has spent most of the past decade working in international cricket, first as England’s fielding coach, then as Bangladesh’s assistant coach, but before that he was a schoolteacher. “I did 10 years of teaching and 10 years of international cricket,” he says, “and this is a merger of the two.”His track record in the game has earned him a lot of credit with , and he is using it to radically overhaul the way they run their youth cricket. If he can prove that what he is doing works, it will change the way we teach the game in England.When Halsall took over at the academy there were two big problems he wanted to fix. The first was a lack of communication between all the people – “I should call them stakeholders,” Halsall says, “but I hate that word” – involved in a player’s development: their parents, school coaches, club coaches and county coaches. Which meant that players were getting mixed and conflicting messages about what they ought to be doing. The second was that he felt so much of the decision-making was still based on opinion rather than fact. And he hated that.“This goes back to my time teaching,” Halsall says. “I’d have a parents evening every term and I had to sit in front of parents and tell them how their child was doing.” It had to be rigorous. “He got this mark in this test and that mark in that test, he’s been handing in his prep on time, he’s always asking me questions in the classroom, he’s logged into the library 45 times this term and he’s accessed these books, so I know he’s been doing his stuff. I couldn’t just say: ‘Well in my opinion your son’s not good enough.’ But in cricket it was still fine to do that.”Halsall is not someone who pretends to have answers he doesn’t, and he readily admits he does not think he, or anyone else, can really pick out which 13-year-old is going to go on to play international cricket. So he was not comfortable with how many people Sussex were cutting from their development programme. It was shaped like a pyramid, with a lot of young players at the bottom and a handful of colts at the top. Halsall has scrapped that. He wants to keep as many people on the pathway for as long as he can. There are 580 boys involved now. Next year it will go up to 800. The idea is that Sussex will not just be turning out county players but committed club players.Each and every one of them has a profile on the app Halsall has designed. So do all Sussex’s professional staff. Which means that so long as someone who is nearby has a camera linked to the app, even if it is just a mate recording with a smartphone, everything a player does in the net or during a match can be captured, tagged and graded. The app clocks whether or not a batsman has middled a shot, and whether a bowler would have hit the top of off. Research done by the England and Wales  Board, and by Halsall, shows that these two simple, sensible, measures are the best basic indicators of a young player’s quality.Over a season, Sussex will build up a huge library of clips, and a huge quantity of data, on every player. Which means, for instance, that their spin coach Ian Salisbury can watch how a young legspinner is getting on in a Melbourne club game this winter, add a note to his profile about a refinement he might make to his technique, then share it with the player, his parents and his club coaches. Or if Chris Silverwood, England’s bowling coach, wants to check in on how Chris Jordan has been bowling in the nets while he is away playing in the Pakistan Super League, all he needs to do is pick up his phone and open Jordan’s profile on the app.All that data also means that where once a young batsman might just have had to suck up a coach’s opinion that he was being dropped because he was not any good against spin bowling, now they can both look at the app and check exactly how well he has been playing the sweep, or how often he has been using his feet. The app includes links to videos of coaching drills, so, with another click, the player can watch clips of how to practise a particular skill and then get on with working on it themselves. Halsall is even building in tags to measure character, that capture, for example, moments when a player was celebrating a teammate’s success.Halsall says he wants to “democratise everything”, that “it’s not going to be my opinion that determines whether you’re going to get to get selected for the next level”, that, in fact, everyone on the app, from the England coaches down to the school coaches, will all be in the same loop. He has been working closely with Mo Bobat, the ECB’s head of player identification, who is a fan of what he is doing. Now Halsall hopes the ECB will roll out his system across the counties. “I will not get my head round if they don’t say to every county this has to be in your indoor school by the end of the year.”"},

And it’s April, so why play a spinner at all? The Somerset man showed he had plenty about him playing for England in Sri Lanka, the kind of sangfroid to deal with the bad days and the ruthlessness to capitalise on the good ones (and the nous to know that each can transform into the other in the blinking of an eye). The slow left-armer’s 6-36 (supported by Jack Brooks’s 4-22) saw Nottinghamshire collapse to an ignominious innings defeat, sending the visitors to the top of the table with the division’s only 100% record. Earlier, Lewis Gregory backed up last week’s fine bowling with 6-68 in the first innings, and two products of the academy (captain, Tom Abell and George Bartlett) had cashed in with centuries. It’s a little early to be talking about whether this could, at last, be  season for  … isn’t it?Another innings away win sent Yorkshire back up north, nestled in second place after  were despatched at the Rose Bowl. Gary Ballance, a man seemingly destined to live in “Hick’sville”, that space reserved for players not quite good enough for international cricket, but very good indeed in the domestic game, top scored for the White Rose with a seven-hour 148, but there was a 90-odd from Joe Root and solid contributions down the order too. Liam Dawson (pitching his tent on the town limits of Hick’sville) bowled 60 overs and made 57 and 92 for the hosts but Tykes’ captain Steve Patterson led his bowling unit well and the wickets were shared round.The perils of enforcing the follow-on were underlined again at Edgbaston, where  had made the most of electing to bat on a very good pitch, piling up 500+ with centuries for Zak Crawley and Ollie Robinson (whose aggregated ages don’t sum to that of teammate Darren Stevens). But Heino Kuhn’s men had over 100 overs in their legs when he asked them to go again and, despite Warwickshire being five down for less than a hundred, resistance usually comes at some point – and it did. Tim Ambrose and paceman Henry Brookes came together when the bowlers had racked up 164 overs in their legs and they stayed for another 45. Kent’s bowlers examined their blisters somewhat ruefully while the batsmen trashed the 123 runs required for the win.Each of Surrey’s top five contributed at least 73 runs to the cause at the Oval, but Rory Burns’ four international bowlers could not get past a combination of Essex resistance and poor weather knocking overs out of the match. Though skipper Ryan ten Doeschate’s century was critical in Essex overhauling Surrey’s 395, Dan Lawrence’s 93 was important too, both for his team and himself. It’s easy to think of Lawrence as yesterday’s man, the next big thing that stayed small, but he’s still only 21. If this is a sign that he is putting his miserable 2018 behind him, Essex, and maybe England, will be very happy indeed.Worcestershire: Daryl Mitchell 114, Hamish Rutherford 123, Ben Cox 100*. Derbyshire: Wayne Madsen 204*, Alex Hughes 104*. Sussex: Stiaan van Zyl 101*. Glamorgan: Marnus Labuschagne 121, Billy Root 126, Kiran Carlson 111. Northamptonshire: Ricardo Vasconcelos 184, Rob Newton 105, Rob Keogh 150. Lancashire: Haseeb Hameed 117, Rob Jones 122.Can’t we just leave these pitches until Patrick Cummins and co turn up breathing fire in August?If Kent’s Ollie Robinson caught the eye with the bat, Sussex’s Ollie Robinson is catching the eye with the ball (this stuff reminds me of the 1980s, when there seemed to be a David Smith playing for every Midlands county). England need a squad of pace bowlers ready for Test cricket in different conditions to cope with form and injuries, so any bowler who is taking wickets should not be beyond consideration. Robinson has made a strong start to 2019 with five wickets in the match against Durham, all bowled or LBW, backing up his six in the season opener against Leicestershire. In 2018, he took 74 wickets at 19 in the Champo, so he knows how to get batsmen out. At 25, he has time on his side."},
{"title": "Will resurgent Tiger Woods beat Jack Nicklaus’s record of 18 majors?", "time": "Mon 15 Apr 2019 ", "category": "US sports", "tags": "Tiger Woods,The Masters,US sports,Golf,features", "content": "t was not at all unfair for Tiger Woods to stay in the moment as the rest of golf cast eyes dreamily forward.  on Sunday took his major haul to 15. Suddenly, from the recent position where the discussion felt irrelevant, Jack Nicklaus’s record tally of 18 is back within view. “I don’t know if Jack is worried or not,” said Woods. “I really haven’t thought about that yet. I’m sure that I’ll probably think of it going down the road. Maybe, maybe not. But right now it’s a little soon. I’m just enjoying 15.”It did not take long for Nicklaus to respond. Worried? You bet he is. “I thought for a long time that he was going to win again,” Nicklaus said of Woods. “The next two majors are at Bethpage, where he has won, and at Pebble Beach, where he has won. So he has got me shaking in my boots.”As the scale of Woods’s victory, arguably his finest in an illustrious but regularly disrupted career, reverberated around the globe golf had been afforded fresh profile. The 43-year-old is now within one of Sam Snead’s 82 PGA Tour wins, a record that has stood since the mid-60s. It is the major quest, though, that sets pulses racing.“It’s nice to get to 15; 18 isn’t a thought,” said Joe LaCava, Woods’s caddie. “Now 15’s here, let’s get to 16. Is the record in play? Sure. The guy’s 43 years old, a guy like him could win when they’re 50. Sixteen is the next mission.”Woods credited LaCava with a key role in his one-shot Masters victory. The pair had a discussion after a dropped shot at the 5th hole on Sunday, during which the caddie urged Woods to “not carry the weight of the world on your shoulders”. LaCava added: “I didn’t put in all the hard work. I didn’t have all the surgeries. I wasn’t down in Florida grinding. So for me, it’s easy. I just show up, try to do a halfway decent job and he has to do all the tough work.”As Nicklaus acknowledged, the year’s upcoming majors present Woods with an opportunity. Next month’s US PGA Championship will see Woods return to Bethpage, where he won the US Open in 2002. The latter tournament, in June, is at the Pebble Beach links where Woods marched to a 15-stroke victory 19 years ago. He has also prevailed in Tour events hosted at the Californian venue. July’s Open Championship at Royal Portrush had already seen scrambling for tickets even before Woods displayed uncharacteristic euphoria in Georgia. The famous 12-stroke win over Tom Kite Beats Sergio García by one stroke Finishes 15 shots ahead of Miguel Ángel Jiménez and Ernie Els Eight ahead of Thomas Bjoørn and Ernie Els at St Andrews Beats Bob May in a three-hole playoff Finishes two ahead of David Duval Wins by three over Retief Goosen Beats Phil Mickelson by three Beats Chris DiMarco on first hole of sudden-death playoff Wins by five over Colin Montgomerie at St Andrews  Two ahead of Chris DiMarco at Royal Liverpool Wins by five over Shaun Micheel Beats Woody Austin by two shots Beats Rocco Mediate on 19th hole of playoff Finishes one ahead of Brooks Koepka, Dustin Johnson and Xander Schauffele“Eighteen is, I think, a lot closer than people think,” said Brooks Koepka, one of the men Woods held off to claim his fifth Masters. “I would say that’s probably what all fans, what we’re thinking. He’s definitely back and 18’s not far.”If Nicklaus would rather retain his place in the record books, he does a fine job of endorsing why Woods might steal it. Even before a ball was struck at Augusta last Thursday the 79-year-old had volunteered Woods as a likely Masters winner on account of evidence gleaned from a recent game of golf; a certain Donald Trump.“I don’t ever pull against anybody,” Nicklaus said. “Nobody wants their record to be broken. But I certainly wouldn’t want Tiger to be hurt and not to be able to do it. Of course he is now pretty healthy and playing well. I wish him well, I always wish the guys well and I want them to play their best and don’t want anybody to play poorly.“Everybody has been asking me about Tiger. Can Tiger win again? Will he win another major? I kept saying, I think so, I think he will. The reason I said that was it all depended on Tiger’s health. If Tiger is healthy, then Tiger didn’t need to worry about his driver. He never drove the ball straight anyway. He always got the ball, from somewhere, up around the green. Tiger is such a great putter, has such a great short game. He has such distance control with his irons, unbelievable distance control, best I’ve seen from anybody in the game. If you get a guy that can do that – even if Tiger wasn’t healthy – he could bunt the ball off the tee somewhere. And with his iron game and his short game, he was going to win again. He topped it off this week by driving the ball. It was a special week for him.”Monday morning delivered confirmation that Woods has risen to No 6 in the world rankings. “The No 1 player in the world is ranked sixth,” claimed Paul Azinger, a former US Ryder Cup captain turned television analyst. Though there are still 17 months to go before the European team visits Whistling Straits, Woods has leapt to the summit of the US Ryder Cup rankings. At the end of this year, in what marks his own first step towards Ryder Cup captaincy, Woods will lead his country in the Presidents Cup. “I’m hoping to make my own team,” said Woods on Sunday, in proving he has playing aspirations for Royal Melbourne.Long before then Woods is expected to make a tournament return at Quail Hollow at the start of May.Should that transpire, a routine PGA Tour event will have been handed the kind of boost money cannot buy.

Woods regularly played practice matches with them as he sought to ascertain whether his body would allow him to be competitive again.“It’s incredible,” said Koepka, who shared second place at the Masters. “I think we all knew it was going to come. I said it last year at the Open. I thought he was ready, raring to go to win a major again and it only took him two more tries. It’s impressive, it’s fun to watch and, just as a fan of golf and Tiger, it’s very special. The atmosphere around Tiger is mind-blowing.”The byproduct of Woods’s prominence is, of course, more attention towards professional golf in general. It is no surprise, therefore, to see his fellow players offer congratulations. Yet it felt on Sunday as if there was a general sense of appreciation towards what the 43-year-old had achieved during one of sport’s greatest ever comebacks. “It’s an amazing story,” said Tommy Fleetwood. “Not just in golf, in sport; in life.”The problem for these golfers will, of course, arrive should Woods become anything close to his dominant past. Then, one assumed, the adulation will not quite be so forthcoming.Schauffele finished alongside Koepka and Dustin Johnson as runners-up. “It was like a dream, honestly,” Schauffele said. “It’s what I watched as a kid. It’s what I watched growing up. Just everything about it, and for me to be a part of it; it was an incredible experience.”Tony Finau’s scenario was different from everyone else – Francesco Molinari aside – because he spent Sunday in Woods’s company. “It was great,” Finau said. “To witness that, a handful of years ago I don’t know a lot of people believed that Tiger would win another major. From what I saw obviously he’s not going anywhere anytime soon.“You can’t say enough about Tiger and what he’s done for the game. It’s great for him to be involved in the game and now he’s got his 15th major. He’s going to be a force to be reckoned with these next few years, I’m sure.”"},

What he [Folau]is saying is not that he doesn’t like or love those people. He’s saying how we live our lives needs to be closer to how God intended them to be.”Vunipola received support from some fellow players and criticism from others. He was booed when he came off the bench for Saracens at Bristol on Saturday and has since met officials from the Premiership champions. “We recognise the complexity of different belief systems and understand Billy’s intention was to express the word of God rather than cause offence,” said the club in a statement on Monday.“However, he made a serious error of judgment in publicly sharing his opinion, which is inconsistent with the values of the club and contravenes his contractual obligations. The player has been formally warned about his future conduct.”Vunipola said his intention was to express his belief in the word of God. “It was never to cause suffering. I can see that my post has hurt people. This is deeply personal and does not represent the views of my team. My Christian faith has sustained me through the ups and many downs of my life.”Later this week Vunipola will meet the RFU, which will remind him of his responsibilities as a leading sporting figure and of the consequences should he post something similar again.If Folau, who was warned last year about the homophobic nature of his posts, does not contest the notice of termination, he will be sacked by the Waratahs and Australia. He has the right to take the matter to a tribunal but, whatever the outcome, the Wallabies’ head coach, , said he would not be picking the 30-year old again.New Zealand will also be without a full-back in the World Cup with Damian McKenzie ruled out until next year after suffering knee ligament damage. The Harlequins and Australia second-row James Horwill will retire at the end of the season at the age of 33, while the Wales outside-half Gareth Anscombe will join the Ospreys next season from Cardiff Blues."},

Desisa, the Ethiopian who won the 2013 race that was marred by the finish line bombing and claimed a second victory in ’15, eased up after realizing he was beaten and finished 2 seconds back. Kenneth Kipkemoi was third, another 8 seconds behind, one of seven Kenyans in the top 10.Worknesh Degefa broke away from defending champion Des Linden and the rest of the women’s pack in the Framingham flats and ran alone for the last 20 miles to her first victory in a major marathon. The 28-year-old Ethiopian finished in 2:23:31 to become the eighth Ethiopian woman to win the race and the third in seven years.Kenya’s Edna Kiplagat was second, reducing a gap of more than two minutes to 42 seconds at the finish. American Jordan Hasay was third and Linden was fifth.One year after an icy rain and a near-gale headwind resulted in the slowest winning times in four decades, race organizers again prepared for the foul New England weather.

Linden took advantage of last year’s storm to splash her way to the first win for an American woman since 1985.But with conditions back to normal, so were the results: East Africans from Kenya and Ethiopia dominating the podiums.A field of 30,000 runners followed the elites, ditching their trash bags and ponchos on the Hopkinton Green before embarking on the 26.2-mile trek from Hopkinton to Copley Square. It’s the first time the race has been run on April 15 since the 2013 attacks; officials planned a ceremony at 2:49 p.m. to honor those killed or maimed by the two pressure cooker bombs that exploded near the finish line.Daniel Romanchuk, 20, became the youngest-ever men’s wheelchair champion in . He finished in 1:21:36 for the fastest time ever for an American.Manuela Schar won the women’s wheelchair race for the second time, adding it to her titles in in Berlin, Chicago, New York and Tokyo.

{"title": "Was Tiger Woods’s Masters win the greatest comeback in sporting history?", "time": "Mon 15 Apr 2019 ", "category": "US sports", "tags": "Tiger Woods,The Masters,US sports,Golf,features", "content": "n the spring of 2014  was at work on the range around the back of his house, practising his short game like always. Days earlier he had shot a 78 on the final day of the Cadillac Championship, the worst fourth-round score of his life. His back had been spasming but he felt he had to get out and exercise. He stroked a flop shot over a bunker and the minute he had finished the swing he fell down flat on his back, overcome with a pain so severe that he could hardly breathe, let alone get back on his feet. He was out of hearing distance and he did not have his mobile phone on him, so there was nothing he could do but lie there and wait for someone to come.It was his seven-year-old daughter, Sam, who found him.“Daddy,” she said, what are you doing lying on the ground?”“Sam, thank goodness you’re here,” he told her. “Can you go tell the guys inside to try to get the cart out to help me back up?”“What’s wrong?”“My back’s not doing very good.”“Again?”“Yes again, Sam, can you please go get those guys?”There are an awful lot of Woods stories but this one, which is in the , always seemed one of the most revealing because it speaks to the pain he has endured, the humiliation he has suffered and the way in which it has all been laid out for the rest of us to see. Here is Woods, the great athlete, helpless as an upturned bug; Woods, the proud champion, pleading with his kid to bring someone who can get him back on his feet; Woods, a man so intensely private that he used to refuse to tell people where he would be playing the very next month, having that helplessness picked over in minute detail by people like me in print and on TV.Tiger Woods has won his fifth Masters title and first major in 11 years after victory in Augusta on Sunday.It has been a long road back for the American, who has suffered numerous injuries and off-course problems.On November 27, 2009 reports emerged that Woods had been injured in a car accident near his Florida home after colliding with a fire hydrant and a tree. Over the next days and weeks the reasons behind the crash became clearer, He said he had \"let his family down\" with \"transgressions\" and announcing an indefinite break from golf. He lost major sponsors including Gatorade and Gillette over his revelations of multiple infidelities and he and his wife Elin Nordegren divorced.Woods, now determined to return to the pinnacle of golf following his self-imposed years in the wilderness, recorded the worst round of his career in January 2015 as he shot an 11-over-par 82 in Arizona. His second-round performance at the Waste Management Phoenix Open left him 13 over and last in a 132-man field. Woods told reporters afterwards: \"It's golf, we all have days like this.\"In June 2016 he announced he was unable to compete at the US Open, the second major of the year, following two back operations in the space of six weeks. He ended a 15-month absence from the game in November but in January 2017 he missed the cut in his first PGA Tour event in almost 18 months, exiting the Farmers Insurance Open after finishing his first two rounds on four over par.The former world number one was unable to contest the 2017 Masters. The chance to compete at Augusta 20 years since he first won the green jacket was denied to Woods who continued to suffer from nerve pain which had required three operations in the space of 19 months. In a throwback to his indiscretions of autumn 2009, in May 2017 Woods was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence in the early hours of Memorial Day. He received a year of probation after pleading guilty to reckless driving and was ordered to undergo 50 hours of community service.In September 2018 Woods shot a one-over 71 for a two-shot victory at the Tour Championship in Atlanta - the 80th victory of his PGA Tour career and his first in more than five years.There are plenty more. One could talk about those first awful moments in 2009 when he crashed his SUV into a tree or the weeks after, when he sealed over all the windows of his house with butcher’s paper to keep the paparazzi cameras out. Or the private luncheon at a Beverly Hills Country Club in 2016 when he had to walk up a flight of stairs backwards because it was the only way he could make it, or how, when he , he could not even tell the police if he was in Florida or California, whether he was coming home or going from it.On Monday morning the talk around Augusta and everywhere else they play golf was all about sweeter things, like how high this victory figured among Woods’s 15 majors and exactly where it ranked among the great sporting comebacks. Now there is no easy answer to that because one has to stack up hundreds of different achievements across dozens of separate eras, which of course was precisely why everyone was chatting about it.How do you measure what Woods did here against, say, the way Niki Lauda finished runner-up in the F1 championship the same season he crashed at the Nürburgring? Lauda was back racing six weeks after he came out of coma. Or Mario Lemieux, who led the Pittsburgh Penguins to their first President’s Trophy in the very same season he finished his radiation treatment for Hodgkin’s lymphoma, while he had a back injury so severe he could not put on his own skates and nearly broke Wayne Gretzky’s scoring record while he was at it? How does it compare with Lester Piggott winning the Breeders’ Cup Mile at the age of 54, just 10 days after he finished a year in prison for tax fraud? Or Monica Seles’s victory at the Australian Open in 1996, three years after she was stabbed in the back on court in Hamburg?And all that is before one gets to the greatest of them all, Muhammad Ali, who won back the heavyweight championship seven years after he was stripped of it and had his boxing licence suspended because he refused to be drafted to fight in Vietnam.Woods was reluctant to claim it was even the best comeback in his own sport. He points to Ben Hogan, who won the US Open a year and a half after he nearly died in a car crash. Hogan was hit by an oncoming bus. He threw himself across his wife’s lap to protect her from the impact and, while she was uninjured, he suffered a broken pelvis, collarbone, ankle and ribs. They mended again but he suffered with blood clots for the rest of his life and had to have emergency surgery. He was told he would never walk again and then he went on to win another six majors. follow us at  like our  and  pages our favourite  subscribe to our  and  channelsAnd yet, for all that, one can say this much: Woods’s story is unique in one important way, unlike all those others, in that he did not suffer physically  personally but physically  personally. He has been tormented in body and soul, his body broken, his back shattered and fused back together again, his reputation shredded and the bits and pieces strewn out for the rest of us to pick over. And here he was, walking off that 18th green, Masters champion, with his family around him, having put it all back together again.“You never give up,” says Woods. “That’s a given. You always fight. Just giving up’s never in the equation.”"},
{"title": "Greg Inglis: the 'man among boys' who dominated rugby league for a decade", "time": "Mon 15 Apr 2019 ", "category": "Rugby league", "tags": "Rugby league,Australia rugby league,NRL,Australia sport,features", "content": "oung Greg Inglis was beautiful. The way he moved, carried himself, how he burned away from opponents at speed, he was like silky Cronulla Sharks champion Steve Rogers except longer and better and more potent.All of that pure, languid human movement, it was all just sweet as the nut. Some people, you watch them move, you’re just gone, enamoured. Inglis was one of them. He was a beautiful thing.And now he is done and done, the great “GI”, this great, rangy fullback and centre-three-quarter; the best of his kind since the Immortal Mal Meninga.For Inglis in his pomp - and it was a period of upwards of a decade - was a magnificent specimen; so aesthetically pure; athletic; and very, very good. And now he’s retired and it’s like we don’t want to let him go. Not yet, anyway, not at 32, not with surely more of the man to give.Alas like the great Andrew Johns, and Ricky Stuart and Peter Sterling (and dare one say it Israel Folau) after so many years of high-impact professional sport, the man has no more to give. A great one’s body has said “. Last couple of years Inglis has had something of the old emu about him, the old croc. As a boy he was lean and fierce. In his dotage he was WG Grace; old knees, old bones. You could see the champion in him. But it’s like Latrell Mitchell imbued his life force, and left the great one spent.Inglis never lacked force, though, even until the end of times.In 2018 he set out to win State of Origin for Queensland, on his own. He was the last of the great Maroon cabal - Cronk, Slater, Smith, Thurston. But he couldn’t hold back the blue tide, this erstwhile son of Bowraville. His end game was then, as it is now.Fox Sports, like many of us, worked out that Inglis was likely to retire yesterday, and thus put together a tasty highlights package together called “Greg Inglis – All the tries”, which sports every one of Inglis’s 149  tries (in 263 games).There’s a whole other show about his State of Origin tries and the odd leaping bit of kit for Australia. And throughout you can see him burning them on the outside, all high chest and hot feet, tearing away from his opponents like the best greyhound at the Wentworth Park dogs, the outstanding kid at the athletics carnival, burning them down the stretch, beaming all the way.The man was beautiful. Young and free. And so long and lean and just plain great.Everyone has Inglis moments.Mine is when he fended off Steve Turner and Mark Gasnier in Game II of State of Origin 2008. Turner was quick and tough, but Inglis rag-dolled him, ended a rep career. Gasnier was a superb centre-three-quarter; plenty gas, plenty bulk; perhaps the best right centre of his time. And Inglis ran him ragged, made him look like a reserve grader from Corrimal Cougars. It’s the mark of a champion; to make a great player look bad.Beau Ryan wasn’t a great player but he was a good one. They didn’t get round him often. He recalls a round 18 match at Campbelltown Stadium in 2008, Wests Tigers vs Melbourne Storm.“It was in the balance until Inglis started trying,” says Ryan. “Then he scored three tries! He set up another. The last one he fended my chest so hard I thought he’d ripped my heart out like that bit in .”Ryan forgives himself, however: “I joined the list of people who’ve been fended off by Greg Inglis. It’s a very long list.”In match reports Storm coach Craig Bellamy declared that Inglis “looked a man among boys”. He was barely 22.James Maloney remembers a Four Nations Test in 2016 when an England player sledged Inglis and “pissed him off”.“From then on he was unstoppable,” says Maloney. “On kick-chase he’d rag-doll whoever brought it back. With the ball he pushed blokes off at will. It was always quick play-the-ball. He won it for them. He was a class above.”Robbie Farah was Inglis’s teammate at South Sydney Rabbitohs and recalls an opposed training session early in 2018. It was Inglis’s first opposed session since his ACL injury. It was expected he would approach it gingerly. Instead, he dominated.“He’d missed all of pre-season and in his first session back he embarrassed the centre he was up against,” says Farah. “He broke tackles, scored tries, set them up. Everyone just sat back and shook their head. Man’s a freak.”Alas, like a champion thoroughbred race horse past its best, Inglis has no more to give. After fourteen seasons of professional, high-octane, full-impact pro sport, the man can barely lift an arm above the horizontal. Such are the rigours of rugby league a young man can develop arthritis; own knees like so much gristle.Indeed if Inglis were a race horse he’d have been out to pasture before now. His owners otherwise would’ve been deemed negligent. Souths did their best to nurse their champion. Yet Father Time has caught Inglis as it catches us all.For certain, Inglis was prime horse-flesh. He was a champion, the measure of which is a man who dominated his era. The same measure can be made of an “Immortal”; someone who doesn’t only beat his next best but donkey licks them, owns them, owns their era.Inglis as future Immortal? You could make a case. Meninga was still competing up to age 34 and scored a try in his last game, a triumphant grand final. Inglis won grand finals, Test series and so many Origins. It would be a shame for his last few months to sully his status. Because if Meninga’s in the pantheon, Inglis is knocking on the door.Because at his best – and he was at his best for over a decade – Greg Inglis didn’t just dominate his peers, he made them look second-rate.It’s the mark of a champion. And a beautiful thing."},

{"title": "Why Tiger Woods’s Masters win could inspire a new generation of golfers", "time": "Mon 15 Apr 2019 ", "category": "Golf", "tags": "Tiger Woods,The Masters,Golf,features", "content": "t’s been hailed as one of the greatest sporting comebacks of all time, and for those in the golfing world, Tiger Woods’s Masters win may be one of the most inspirational too – specifically in ushering in a new generation of players.Twenty-two years after Woods first won the Masters, golf is still often perceived as having stuffy attitudes, restrictive dress codes and high costs. But there is hope that the 43-year-old’s success in Augusta, Georgia, on Sunday will encourage a younger audience to tee off.Nick Pink, chief executive officer at England , said he believed the sport still struggled to attract BAME participants, but Woods’s resurgence might help to change that.“Golf is often driven by middle-class and white men, and I think he appeals to a more diverse audience,” he said. “Him coming back into the fore alongside players like Tony Finau will help the perception too.”Woods became a huge global star with his series of major wins, which began in the late 1990s and ran through the 2000s, and he inspired a generation to turn to the sport. His decline seemed to be echoed in the levels of grassroots participation, but his win could see another boost.A spokesperson for the British Golf Industry Association (BGIA), which represents some of the biggest brands in the golf industry, said: “Woods’s journey sends an important message to all, but perhaps especially to younger people – that it is not perfection which drives success, it is talent, effort and hard work. Woods’s very human flaws have been well-documented, but the fact that he appears to have learnt from his mistakes, grown from them and risen again to such dizzying heights is a great sporting story.“The BGIA works very closely with other organisations in the golf industry to attract younger people to the game, on programmes with the PGA [Professional Golfers’ Association] and the Golf Foundation amongst others. There can be little doubt that golf will receive a boost from Woods’s win and attract new, young players to golf.”Andrew Witherup, club professional at Formby golf club in Liverpool, said: “This will definitely attract the generation who grew up with  but were too young to see him in his prime.”Witherup, 50, says the pool of new starters is already diversifying. Around 50% of their junior section is made up of children whose parents aren’t golfers.For the influx of outsiders, he credits Woods’s transformation of the pastime into one that’s perceived as good for overall fitness and wellbeing. “It’s not like how it used to be, you don’t see anyone on TV smoking anymore,” he added.The sentiment was shared by Sam Jones, 29, an assistant golf professional at Sundridge Park golf club in Bromley, Kent. “Before Tiger, golfers were never considered to be athletes but now a lot of them are embracing that. They’re always down the gym – it’s slowly but surely becoming a young person’s sport,” he said.For its own part, one way Sundridge has been trying to embrace younger players is by introducing them to younger members of its golf academy in an effort to counteract the sport’s cliquey and sometimes solitary nature.Another barrier, believed Jones, were the stereotypes which still exist within the game – of white, older, wealthy men parading around in tartan trousers. He said that “people like Woods are doing a lot to dispense with that stigma”.“I like to think his win will encourage more young people to play,” said Jones. “It’s certainly a really [good] time to be in the sport.”Neil Randall, a director at British Junior Golf Tour, a not-for-profit company that provides junior golf competitions around the UK, has already witnessed first-hand the pervasiveness of Woods’s influence.“If you ask any junior of any age who their favourite golf player is, they all say Tiger,” said Randall. “My son in particular admires his focus.”Randall, who insisted Woods’s latest achievement won’t be the first time a generation with access to YouTube will have witnessed his prowess, added the win was “great for golf”.For Paul Wiseman, executive director for education at the PGA, a surge in youth participation is not a prediction but a given.“Whenever Tiger’s involved there’s always an increase in people getting involved in the sport,” said Wiseman. “He always draws people in who’ve never watched golf on TV.“When anybody gives that intensity to achieve something, I think it has an impact on people who are just ticking along to push themselves.“He’s definitely made it cooler – just look at the clothes he’s wearing. The cool factor is inevitably part of making young people want to play.”"},
{"title": "Portable kit to treat babies with jaundice goes on trial in Peru", "time": "Tue 16 Apr 2019 ", "category": "Americas", "tags": "Global health,Peru,Americas,news", "content": "Health workers in a remote province high in the Peruvian Andes are trialling a revolutionary method to treat babies with jaundice – with nothing more than a colour-coded ruler, blood reader and carrycots.Their goal is to screen, diagnose and treat jaundice in 12,000 newborns over the next two years in a country where 90% of the public health facilities lack the capability to adequately diagnose or treat it in newborns.Jaundice is caused by a build up of bilirubin in the blood and in newborns is common – affecting . However, left untreated, it can pose serious health concerns such as cerebral palsy and deafness. In , the rates of jaundice-induced brain damage are  than in wealthier countries.“Jaundice is a serious public health issue here in ,” said Fernando Pérez Lastra, national director of non-profit development organisation Inmed Andes, which is launching the two-year project with the backing of Peru’s ministry of health.“In 2016 and 2017, around 20,000 cases of jaundice were reported [nationwide], but in 2018 that figure went up to 31,000. It’s not clear if that jump was from better reporting or if there were simply more cases – but we need solutions. That’s why an intervention like this is so important and so necessary: we have to identify these cases before complications arise.”Although the health workers’ new medical tools may sound basic, they are actually a combination of three highly sophisticated technologies – dubbed the “” – which were developed specifically by Inmed and various partners for remote and low-resource regions like Peru’s central highlands.A yellow-graded “”, held up against the newborn’s nose, allows health workers to screen the infant’s jaundice levels; a  loads a heel prick of blood on to a cartridge and measures bilirubin concentrations; and a , shaped like a carrycot, provides the infant with high-intensity phototherapy.The entire kit is the first complete jaundice management package of its kind. Elements have been previously trialled in Burundi, Cambodia, Ethiopia and India, but this is the first time all three technologies are being used together.“Traditionally, a baby with neonatal jaundice in a remote area would have to travel long distances to receive adequate treatment and technology,” said neonatal specialist Dr Donna Brezinski, founder and CEO of Little Sparrows Technologies, which developed the Bilihut.“Instead of the baby going to the facility, we’re bringing the equipment to the baby and facilitating diagnosis and treatment.”Neonatal jaundice normally peaks in intensity during the first week of life and then self-resolves, with only 10% of newborns worldwide requiring medical intervention. But in areas like Junín, many mothers give birth at home, and those who give birth at hospital generally return home before symptoms appear. As a result, many neonatal jaundice cases are either dealt with very late, or in some cases, not at all.Left untreated, severe neonatal jaundice can lead to kernicterus, serious brain damage that can result in cerebral palsy, blindness, deafness and death.“Currently, a lot of the community health workers and health personnel know about jaundice but they don’t have a systematic way of identifying it,” said Kristin Callahan, Inmed’s director of international programmes, who is currently helping train health workers to identify symptoms.“They might see a baby where it’s so yellow that they know for sure it’s jaundice and they then refer it to hospital. But only some hospitals have treatment facilities, with old-syle devices that take much longer to treat the infants. The Bilihut should cut that treatment time in half.”Jaundice is caused by a build up of bilirubin in the blood, which causes yellowing in the eyes and skin. But estimating an infant’s jaundice level by eyesight alone can be problematic, said Brezinski.“Jaundice can be very difficult to identify, particularly with darker-pigmented populations.“But every single delay [in that child receiving treatment] might lead to a poor outcome such as neurological brain damage or a spectrum of disorders, like hearing loss or a speech delay, that wouldn’t be detected until they’re much older.”Over the next two years, 40 community health workers will travel door-to-door in 25 regions across Peru, screening for jaundice.Where necessary, they will refer newborns for blood tests in nearby hospitals and health centres, and subsequent treatment in the phototherapy cots, which can be set up next to mothers’ beds.Health worker Jusely Susan Huachiva Coporras, 27, is undergoing the current Bilikit training and wants to share her experience and knowledge of jaundice with other mothers.“My two children suffered from jaundice, and the first had to be hospitalised and undergo phototherapy,” she says.“I really believe in this project, because I don’t want any newborn to have to go through what mine did.”"},
{"title": "High court suspends Home Office policy limiting support for slavery victims", "time": "Wed 17 Apr 2019 ", "category": "Global development", "tags": "Global development,Exploitation in focus,news", "content": "A high court judge has suspended a Home Office policy that cuts off after six weeks all statutory support to slavery victims in the UK, ruling that it risks causing “irreparable harm to very vulnerable individuals”.The Home Office must now immediately extend assistance to all slavery and trafficking victims requiring support in the UK, estimated to be about 600 people, over the next few months.Under the Modern Slavery Act, the Home Office is required to provide safe housing, counselling and financial support for 45 days to people who have been formally identified as victims of slavery or trafficking.Duncan Lewis, the law firm that challenged the Home Office’s 45-day policy in court, said Wednesday’s ruling would allow victims more time to recover from their ordeal.“We’re really happy no one else will be left at the mercy of the Home Secretary’s 45-day cliff-edge drop in support,” said Ahmed Aydeed, public law director at Duncan Lewis.“Recovery is a vital form of relief for a trafficked and enslaved person, and we have a duty to assist victims in their physical, psychological and social recovery. Without this support, victims are left at an enhanced risk of re-trafficking and enslavement. There is no clinical nor logical basis to limit support to 45 days after they’ve been formally identified as victims.”The ruling follows last month’s decision by a high court in Birmingham that the 45-day policy is potentially unlawful, and will be heard again in June.In March, the high court there heard from two slavery victims over the potential impact a termination of support would have. The first victim, who was trafficked into cannabis cultivation and subsequently criminalised and illegally detained in prison, said that if his support ended after 45 days  and unable to attend medical appointments without the backing of a support worker.The second, an Albanian woman who was trafficked into sexual exploitation, said: “I am scared that I will have a mental breakdown and that will affect my ability to care for my daughter.”“[T]here is a real risk of irreparable harm to a significant number of vulnerable victims of slavery and trafficking if their support were to end after 45 days,” Mr Justice Julian Knowles wrote in his judgment.“Granting this relief will also avoid the cost and inconvenience of large numbers of individual claimants having to apply for interim relief to this court.”Until now, victims have been allowed to apply for extensions after their 45 days of support expire, but it appears that most victims – and those assisting them – have been unaware of the policy, and the criteria applied to grant the extensions, which are both unpublished. More than 1,500 extensions requests have been made to the Home Office since 2015, according to the judgment, nearly all of which (95.8%) were granted. But these requests were only in relation to a small proportion (11.2%) of people who receive support, which means that the vast majority of people are perhaps unaware that they could seek extensions.Ahmed said Wednesday’s ruling in support of all trafficking and slavery victims was due to the two clients who first challenged the policy.“It really is down to the bravery of our clients: after all that they’ve been through, they have taken up this challenge to ensure others who are trafficked and enslaved do not lose their support after 45 days,” he said.“We’re extremely disappointed with the Home Secretary, who on multiple occasions conceded in open court that he has a duty to continue supporting victims, and yet is attempting to renege on his duty and concession.A full decision on the unlawfulness of the Home Office’s 45-day policy is expected by June.A Home Office spokesperson said: “The government is committed to ensuring all victims of modern slavery get the support they need. It would not be appropriate to comment on ongoing legal proceedings.”"},
{"title": "Upward slope: how skateboarding transformed the ‘Manchester of Finland’", "time": "Tue 16 Apr 2019 ", "category": "Europe", "tags": "Cities,Finland,Skateboarding,Europe,features", "content": "here’s little to distinguish Tampere from hundreds of other post-industrial small towns and cities across the global north. With a population of 232,000, it is Finland’s second-largest urban area, known as the Manchester of  due to its past as an industrial powerhouse. And like many other towns and cities, after a century of prosperity the decline of industry left Tampere facing an existential crisis. It now counts its major claims to fame as  (a black sausage) and the world’s only Moomin museum.Although Finland  in everything from income to equality to education, the collapse of its major trading partner, the Soviet Union, in 1991 left the country struggling with unemployment, particularly among the young. Tampere was not immune. The global financial crisis compounded Finland’s problems; youth unemployment in the Pirkanmaa region, which includes Tampere, hit 28% in 2009.Alienation and even  became a serious issue, and most young Finns know someone who has slipped down the path into alcoholism. The city was struggling to find a strong identity and purpose – and like many smaller places it was also victim to a gravitational pull on talent, investment and resources from a much bigger city: in Tampere’s case, Helsinki.Although many of Tampere’s old factories are architectural marvels, as abandoned buildings they can create giant “ghost zones”, and all too easily transform into centres for drug-taking, vagrancy and crime.Tampere is emblematic of changes across Finland: as industries close, forestry becomes increasingly mechanised and the population both ages and shrinks, young Finns often grow up bored and frustrated, killing time until they leave for the big cities. Census figures suggest the population of non-metropolitan areas will shrink by 180,000 over the next 20 years. For young people in smaller cities, it can be particularly hard to imagine a positive future.That’s why the ramp dogs are here.In a sprawling yard below an old pulp mill beside Lake Näsijärvi, near the city, members of Kaarikoirat (“Ramp Dogs”), a self-organised association of skateboarders , are hard at work, pouring concrete and smoothing out a gradient over a hand-built wooden frame.“I have so many friends who are stuck,” says Ville Natunen, a Kaarikoirat member and now a professional skatepark builder with the Canadian firm Beaver Concrete. “They’re unemployed, they get passive and depressed. Eventually, they stop believing they can do anything.”In 2010 Kaarikoirat members decided to take matters into their own hands. Fed up with their calls for municipal investment in skateboarding meeting with indifference, they set about building a skatepark of their own, called Tikkutehdas DIY, in the ruins of an old matchstick factory. None of them had any prior construction experience, but each day more young people – many of whom the state and NGOs had previously failed to engage – began showing up to lend a hand.“In the beginning, there was no contact with the city’s decision-makers,” recalls founder Teemu Grönlund. “Skateboarding had no spokesperson. But we didn’t sit around and complain; we worked hard, by hand, to make our dreams come true.”In 2015, after endless meetings and proposals a second project, Iso-Vilunen, became the biggest outdoor concrete skatepark in Finland. The same year, Kaarikoirat got permission to build a mini-ramp under a bridge in the heart of the city. Then it convinced the city to move unused granite blocks to create a new skate plaza in a park that had formerly been used primarily by problem drinkers. The skate plaza brought in families, reactivating a previously unloved outdoor social space, and helped to turn the little-used public stage in the park into a lively spot for events and gigs – all at almost no cost to the city.“What Kaarikoirat has achieved really captures the power of this emerging self-organised and action-based approach,” says Timo Hämäläinen, an urban policy adviser. “They proved that facilities for the skateboarding community make social life better for everyone – all with no assistance from the city; without any power, resources or allies.”Today, Kaarikoirat does have the backing of the city of Tampere. After years of concerted pressure, it has become an important ally in helping the municipality achieve its own stated objectives, from increasing civic participation to urban regeneration and reducing youth unemployment.In 2016, the government handed Kaarikoirat the keys to a 680 sq metre factory building next to Lake Näsijärvi that was once the centre of a major forestry industry. With the local job centre covering salaries, the ramp dogs went to work on an enormous indoor concrete bowl, Kenneli DIY. It now hosts a wide range of cultural events, from music festivals to Trelogy, one of the biggest skateboarding events in the Nordic countries.Many of the ramps are branded with “Visit Tampere”, an ongoing partnership with the official tourism body, which provides funding in return for use of content produced by the skateboarders, allowing it to market Tampere as a young, exciting and culturally significant city. Even city hall – a boxy, modernist building that looks out over a Lutheran church – has a huge poster of skateboarders on its ground-floor window, demonstrating how deeply skating has been integrated into Tampere’s brand.Kaarikoirat also explicitly reaches out to young people. In 2017 it started offering three- to six-month placements to young people, who receive a boost to their unemployment benefit for the duration and are taught about all aspects of the organisation, helping out with the day-to-day operation or specific projects. Some are then hired by Kaarikoirat for up to a year, building, doing publicity, running events or developing projects, with the state supporting their salary. Kaarikoirat also helps facilitate internships and projects that offer academic credits for carpentry, 3D printing and modelling.“Tampere’s industrial heritage is our roots, but we have been forced to recreate our story,” says the deputy mayor Anna-Kaisa Heinämäki. “We face tough competition from Helsinki in all areas.” Making the city attractive to young people is key, she says. “I believe our openness to collaborations with students and organisations such as Kaarikoirat has been crucial. The typical citizen of Tampere is 24 years old; so delivering services and facilities they want requires us to be innovative and listen to all kinds of new ideas.“A big question for society is: how does government collaborate successfully with these initiatives with deep roots in the local community; maturing and scaling them, to reach more unemployed young people? Yet, if too much government gets involved, things become more official and all the fun is gone. We don’t know what works yet, so we’re going to have to explore different models.”Certainly the success of Kaarikoirat suggests that, rather than expensive, large-scale developments in the city centre like casinos and skyscrapers, it is micro-initiatives that offer smaller cities the best chance of catalysing a vibrant urban fabric and preventing brain drain to the likes of Helsinki. For such cities, the future seems to lie in cultivating a unique identity and empowering citizens to solve problems.“Embracing DIY urbanism could play a significant role in giving smaller cities an edge – although it’s hard to say how significantly, because this is still a new phenomenon,” Hämäläinen says. “Bureaucratic, siloed structures are a relatively recent development – historically, cities built with a very organic, DIY practice has made them successful and sustainable over time.”"},

This time it’s through a shared antipathy for the $100m-plus in subsidies this booming city has just handed to , the world’s most valuable retailer.The ink has barely dried on a deal that the state of Tennessee and the city awarded Amazon and there are now only a few small hurdles remaining before Amazon starts moving in to a downtown office complex planned for  Yards.But an unusual alliance of free-market libertarians and union-backed activists is determined to hold the politicians and executives responsible for the deal to account. Their hope is that it will serve as a warning to others looking to hand public money to profitable companies in return for the promise of new jobs.“This is one area where libertarians and socialists can agree on something: this is a bad idea,” said John Mozena, president of the  a free market advocacy group and a self described libertarian.Local activist Odessa Kelly agrees. A parks and recreations employee and member of the union-backed  coalition she says the deal is symptomatic of an approach that is failing the city while handing millions to a company that doesn’t need it.We are being moved around like pawns on a chess board for the rich,” she says. “I hate to say it but we have become a playground for the rich.”It wasn’t supposed to be this way. Last November  that the capital of country music was one of its chosen cities, following a long search to build “HQ2” – a second base away from its Seattle headquarters. States and cities  in a sometimes bizarre beauty pageant to win the prize. Arizona offered Amazon a to seal the deal.There is no more working class in the city of Nashville. We do middle class work but we can’t afford middle class livesIn the end HQ2 was split between Queens in New York and Virginia’s Arlington County. Nashville picked up the consolation prize and a promise of 5,000 high-paying jobs.For all the political schmoozing and promises of a “prime” future, being part of HQ2 has proven problematic. The backlash from residents and politicians in New York was so fierce that . Politicians in Virginia too have felt the  who worry about the impact of gentrification.The fight in Nashville is far from over. Following pressure from Stand up Nashville and others, Amazon (and any other corporation receiving taxpayer funds) will have to publish accounts to prove it is living up to its promise to deliver high-paid jobs to locals. Amazon is company to promise big benefits in return for subsidies, but few will be as closely watched in the years ahead.Kelly is worried about the impact of the company on a city that has already been transformed by a rush of investment. “We are being pushed out to the fringes of the city,” she said. “There is no more working class in the city of Nashville. We do middle class work but we can’t afford middle class lives.”After the New York deal imploded Holly Sullivan, head of Amazon’s economic development team worldwide, told  residents had nothing to fear.“Community engagement is something that is, quite frankly, in our DNA,” Sullivan said. “You are never going to locate in a community or neighborhood that you are going to have 100% support and, oftentimes, the most vocal are those against something. But, it’s also an education opportunity for us to learn, ‘what are their priorities?’ They might, actually, once they get to know us, realize that we might be aligned on some of those priorities.”That’s the mistake cities are still making. They are acting like Amazon is a car factory in the 1950sAmazon has promised to create over 5,000 jobs paying an average of over $150,000 in the city. Given the median US household income is $61,372, it is little wonder politicians were so eager for its business.But for Mozena those numbers hide a bigger issue: Amazon doesn’t need the money and the city can’t afford it. Plenty of other cities offered “way more money” than Nashville, said Mozena. “In fact, Amazon just announced they were adding hundreds of jobs in Austin, Texas and didn’t ask for money because they just wanted the workforce in Austin that much.”When Amazon announced the hunt for HQ2 it said that while incentives played a role, the primary issue was workforce. Nashville, like Austin, has that workforce.“That’s the way jobs and the economy are moving,” said Mozena. “It’s not the old model that a city or state lures in a factory and then people move to where the jobs are. These companies are so much more dependent on knowledge, on skilled labour, that they are going to where the people are. That’s the mistake cities are still making. They are acting like Amazon is a car factory in the 1950s.”The academic research suggests Mozena is right.  by Timothy Bartik, an economist who specializes in regional economics at the W E Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo, Michigan, found 75% of companies would have moved to a city or state even without incentives.Politically, however, polling shows that the all-important swing voter is won over by announcements of new jobs, he said. At least for now.Anne Barnett, co-chair of Stand Up Nashville, said she had had many discussions with police officers, firefighters and others recently who, while “on the other end of the political spectrum”, were dubious about the deal too. “There are a growing number of folks who are very critical of these incentives,” she said. “It’s a moral issue.”The impact of the deal is already being felt in Nashville, where rents are rising. Barnett said residents were worried about the future of North Nashville, a historically African American neighborhood that has so far escaped the full force of gentrification, which has hit many other areas of the city.“This money isn’t free,” said Mozena. “It is money that can be used for roads, police officer and schools, investments that can significantly improve the quality of life for communities. You are taking money away from investments that can make your community a good place to live and attractive to companies in the long term.”And that, he says, is “something that the principled left and the principled right” can agree on."},

She claims a two-tier system exists, with Somali nationals seen as tools for project implementation rather than as people with knowledge.“We had no means of contributing to the agenda of the day,” she says, referring to her days at the UN. “Every time we joined teleconference meeting with the Nairobi regional office, we had to just listen to items that were prepared without our knowledge.”Other Somalis working with international aid organisations interviewed for this article voiced the same concerns. Not wishing to be named for fear of losing their jobs, they said they felt their voices are not valued and that they are excluded from taking ownership.The  (Scotou) says it frequently receives complaints from Somali aid sector staff who talk about lack of respect and unfair treatment by foreign managers.“It is difficult to access these international organisations,” says Scotou general secretary, Ahmed Hassan. “They are based inside Mogadishu airport, which is heavily guarded; there is nothing much we can do to advocate for the rights of local workers. Somali staff members, especially casual workers who report to the base every day, are not even allowed to use their mobile phones at work for security reasons, which means they cannot call their family members even in an emergency. This is unacceptable.”Somalia’s fragile government is recovering from a decades-long civil war and is under frequent attack from the al-Shabaab militia group. Last month, militants , killing 11 people including deputy minister, Saqar Ibrahim Abdalla.“The lack of strong government and the absence of an independent NGO regulatory board contributes to the exploitation of workers. The ministry of labour has recently finalised the development of a new labour law which if passed will protect and greatly contribute to the welfare of workers,” says Hassan.Experts say the lack of local participation in the design and development of aid programmes is a key reason for their failure. , the Humanitarian Policy Group (HPG) at the ODI found that “INGO staff participants indicated that their HQ offices would often send them proposals based on the donor area of interest, with field staff tasked with implementing assessments or activities (having) little room for adjustment.”This was “confirmed by , which found that a quarter of respondent field staff did not believe that affected people were able to influence programme design, and that the views of affected people were not considered because of a lack of engagement and consultation by aid agencies”, said the HPG.Researcher Badra Yusuf said national staff often feel excluded. “They also seem to take the burden of all the field challenges which often amounts to outsourcing workload and problems,” she says.“Often the failure of programmes are attributed to things not working well in the field when actually people fail to consider the risks and causes of failures that could have being avoided if proper planning with national staff and communities were made at the planning stage.”Koshin, now an independent consultant, said there is a culture of acceptance: “They [Somali staff] know they are being mistreated but cannot say anything. I decided not to work with the UN agencies under such a humiliating environment.”While organisations emphasise the importance of local engagement, Koshin says they isolate staff who could serve as a bridge into communities.“There is always an international staff assigned to supervise Somali nationals regardless of their capacity, position, experience or level of education,” she says. “They assume that we are not competent enough to execute our duties and the fact that we are Somalis we are bound to make mistakes therefore, there is always that white or non-Somali looking after you, watching and correcting your mistakes.”In November, Fadumo Dayib, a former presidential candidate, accused the UN in Somalia of . She resigned as UN Women Somalia country director in October.“Upon reporting for duty in Somalia I was told no Somali was allowed to hold such a position. I was verbally harassed, bullied and ostracised. I spent a hellish one year and six months dealing with this,” “Apparently, a Somali by virtue of her/his ethnicity, is a terrorist, works in cahoots with the government, is corrupt and biased. They might as well as put a sign saying: ‘No Somalis and dogs allowed,’” .“To them, we are just like beneficiaries, regardless of our capacity,” says one Somali INGO staff member. “We always see projects that do not reflect the needs of the community but we don’t have the platform or opportunity to correct or shape anything. International staff overlook our capacity and that is why many relief programmes in the country are not sustainable.”Joe Contreras, spokesman for the UN mission in Somalia, said the two UN missions and 21 agencies in the country employed 1,300 Somali nationals and many ran staff associations to represent their interests. He insisted UN leadership “routinely” travelled outside Mogadishu’s airport compound.“In many agencies, national staff participate in senior management meetings, take part in organisational planning, and are included in high-level decision-making platforms for discussions on the strategic direction of the organisations,” he says.“While human resource procedures and practices vary across agencies, many agencies make active efforts to promote talent development and career advancement for national staff.“A number of Somali national staff have been recruited into international posts in other countries. Given the international character of the UN, representative and director-level posts across all UN countries are hired based on international recruitment.“The UN resident coordinator office is not aware of any efforts by referenced ‘local labour rights groups’ in Mogadishu to reach out to the UN to discuss on issues of this nature, and would be very pleased to do so.”"},

However, it was unclear whether people could also spot a philanderer of the same sex.Writing in the journal  researchers described how they asked heterosexual white participants to judge the facial features of 189 white adults who had been photographed and taken part in previous research. Overall, 293 men and 472 women rated pictures of women, while 299 men and 452 women judged images of men, rating on a scale of one to 10 how likely they thought each person was to be unfaithful.Those in the pictures had previously reported the extent of any cheating and whether they had “poached” a partner from someone else. Their photos had already been rated for attractiveness, untrustworthiness and how masculine or feminine they appeared.The results showed men and women as a whole gave higher scores of unfaithfulness to the images of men who had self-reported more cheating or poaching.“Therefore, perceived unfaithfulness may indeed contain some kernel of trust in male faces,” the authors said. However, there was no such effect for the images of women.When the team examined what about the men’s faces might have offered clues to their unfaithfulness, they found the standout feature was how masculine the face appeared. Further analysis confirmed facial masculinity was linked to self-reported unfaithfulness, although it did not completely predict it.However the team stressed many other factors are linked to whether someone is unfaithful. “The actual unfaithfulness varies in our sample of faces, and 4-8% of this variation is accounted for by the average perceived unfaithfulness of those faces,” said Dr Yong Zhi Foo, the first author of the research from the University of Western Australia.The team said they were surprised that participants only saw cheating and poaching of partners in the face of men, and suggested it could be down to a number of factors, including women being less prone to cheating than men, or that women’s use of cosmetics masks links between facial features and behaviours.They said further experiments with a wider range of photographed participants – including older people who might have had more time to be unfaithful – were necessary.Dr Kristen Knowles, an evolutionary psychologist from Queen Margaret University in Edinburgh, who was not involved in the study, said it was interesting the research made a clear connection between perceptions of infidelity and actual infidelity.She said the results may only be seen in men as women may be less likely to self-report they have cheated on a partner or poached someone else’s.But Knowles stressed it should not be assumed that men with masculine faces were likely to be unfaithful. “We should be aware that these behaviours are incredibly complex, and are likely to be influenced by many factors, including social and cultural effects, personality, genetics and life experiences,” she said."},

But the school administrator in her home town in  looked at her long hair, noticed the boy’s name on her ID and kicked her out “like a dog”, admonishing her for wearing “a costume”. She refused to cut her hair and wear a tie. “I was already Viviana. I didn’t want to dress up like a boy.”When she was 15, Gonzalez, now 48, gave up on studying. She became a sex worker to survive, and also held other jobs, including one as a seamstress. Then, in 2016, a friend offered to help her get a housing subsidy; in reality, Gonzalez was being inveigled into a school for transgender people in Buenos Aires.She recalls how a teacher helped her sign up: “He opened his arms and said: ‘OK, amiga, welcome to the Mocha Celis. You’re going to go to high school.’ I think I had been waiting for those words since I was 11 years old,” says Gonzalez, flicking away a tear.“I know a lot of people would say: ‘Finishing high school, that’s nothing.’ For me, it was everything.”Located in the neighbourhood of Chacarita, the  is the first school of its kind anywhere in the world. It is named after a trans woman who never went to school and was murdered (friends suspect a police officer). The three-year programme enables young people and adults to obtain their high school diploma, or finish elementary school.Argentina’s  are schools for people who did not complete high school. They are typically run by social or human rights organisations and are tailored for specific communities. La Mocha has classes you would find in any school – history, maths, biology – as well as more specialised subjects, such as gender and health education. It has trans and non-trans teachers, a mixed bathroom, and afternoon classes to accommodate sex work.And it is inclusive. The school has drawn other members of the LGBTQ community, cisgender single mothers, married women over 50, and migrants. It started with 21 students; now, there are about 130.“What we want is for people to be able to say who they are. That which isn’t named doesn’t exist, or is invisible in a system. That’s why we call ourselves the baccalaureate transvestite-trans,” says Francisco Quiñones Cuartas, the school’s director. The term transvestite is commonly used in Argentina.Classes started in 2012, months before Argentina passed a historic law that  on official identification without having to undergo sex reassignment surgery or hormone therapy.Silvana Alvarez, a Mocha graduate, says the school was “a second home”. Its curriculum, which includes projects such as creating a sex education toolkit to be used in public schools, was empowering, says Alvarez, 45, who is now studying communications at university. The decorated martial artist left sex work to teach self-defence, and a playwright has cast her as the lead in a theatre production about her life.Some graduates work at the school, while others are in the civil service, helped by the introduction of a quota for trans workers in the province of Buenos Aires.Access to education in the city has improved. In 2005, 20.8% of trans women and transvestites said they had finished high school, compared with 24.3% in 2016, according to research by the city and the Mocha Celis school. The same study showed that the percentage currently in school rose from 10.4% to 26%.Tireless activism in Argentina has secured some of the most progressive policies in the world, yet trans people still confront a violent reality.

The city government pays teacher salaries, but like other , it doesn’t cover rent or maintenance costs. Amid the ongoing recession, students have had to collect donations to pay the school’s electricity bill.Critics have accused the Mocha of “self-discrimination” by creating a separate school, a suggestion Quiñones Cuartas rejects. “There is a self-determination to not participate in spaces that discriminate against us and inflict violence upon us.”Lautaro Rosa, a trans man, said he was guarded when he arrived as a student in 2017. He always lived his gender, and paid the price in the schoolyard.“This school helps me, because it’s no longer just me,” says Rosa, 38. “I, Lautaro, am in my place.

As the young leaves are still developing their chloroplasts, the leaves tend to be a lighter green. The new leaves are also thinner, with fewer waxy or tough layers, making them more translucent. What’s more, the leaves look brighter because they tend to have fewer additional pigments other than chlorophyll, so the green colour can shine through more clearly. But this is only a passing phase before the leaves turn darker green as their chloroplasts mature and the leaves grow thicker and more opaque.Another striking feature is how the trees in springtime have been tending to come into leaf earlier over recent decades, and that reflects how average spring temperatures across the UK have  over the last few decades.

{"title": "Researchers 'reboot' pig brains hours after animals died", "time": "Wed 17 Apr 2019 ", "category": "Science", "tags": "Medical research,news", "content": "The brains of decapitated pigs can be partially revived several hours after the animal has died, researchers have revealed, with some of the functions of cells booted back up when an oxygen-rich fluid is circulated through the organ.The scientists stress that the brains do not show any signs of consciousness – for example, there was no sign that different parts of the brain were sending signals to each other – and that it does not change the definition of death.But they say they have found a way to prevent brain cells from sustaining irreparable damage as blood stops circulating, and even to restore some of the cells’ functions.“This is not a living brain. But it is a cellularly active brain,” said Prof Nenad Sestan from Yale University, who led the research.Sestan added that the results had exceeded expectations. “When we started this study we really never imagined we would get to this point,” he said.The team said the approach could provide a new way to study the brain, and even help in the development and testing of new therapies for stroke and other conditions in which bloodflow to parts of the brain is blocked, causing cells to die. A number of studies, including those involving cells taken from dead brains, have suggested brain cells might not inevitably die after blood stops circulating., researchers in the US reported how they sought to examine this further by taking brains from 32 pigs that had been killed in a slaughterhouse. Four hours after their deaths the arteries of the pig brains were hooked up to a sophisticated system dubbed BrainEx, which pumped an oxygenated synthetic blood through the organ. This fluid contained a host of nutrients as well as other substances to tackle processes that lead to cell death, and the circulation was continued for six hours.At that point, the team found the circulating fluid successfully flowed through blood vessels in the brain, including tiny capillaries, and that the blood vessels were able to dilate in response to a drug, while the brain as a whole consumed oxygen and glucose from the fluid and released carbon dioxide back into it at similar rates to an intact brain. Unlike pig brains that were left alone for 10 hours after death, the organs that had been hooked up to the BrainEx system for six hours had not decomposed, while their cells and neurons were apparently on a par or even in better condition than for pig brains analysed one hour after death.What is more, the cells showed certain functions, including the release of various immune-response substances when triggered.After tissueswere removed from the brains and flushed of the BrainEx fluid the researchers found individual neurons were still able to function.“What we are showing is that the process of cell death is a gradual, stepwise process and that some of those processes can be either postponed, preserved or even reversed,” said Sestan.The team said that while the BrainEx fluid was circulating, they monitored the brains to check for any signs of organised electrical activity that might suggest consciousness. “That monitoring didn’t show any kind of organised global electrical activity,” said Dr Stephen Latham, a bioethicist and co-author of the study, adding that the circulating fluid contained substances that would have blocked activity of brain cells.But, he said, the team had been ready for signs of consciousness. “Had that appeared they would have lowered the temperature of the brain and used anaesthesia to stop that kind of activity,” said Latham, adding that at present there are no ethics committees set up for such an eventuality, and it remained unclear in any case if the technique could ever restore consciousness.The researchers said it was not clear if the circulating BrainEx fluid was helping to patch up molecular and cellular damage that had already begun, or whether it was simply slowing down such processes, postponing cell death. Latham said the next step would be to see if the system can keep the various cellular functions going for longer. A patent for the system has already been filed.Experts writing in two articles also in Nature said the research  – not least whether consciousness would have been recorded if the BrainEx fluid had not contained substances to block brain cell activity, and whether other methods were needed to assess consciousness.  the prospect that one day some brain function might be restored after devastating injuries may mean doctors and family members could be less willing for organs to be removed from people for transplant.Prof Tara Spires-Jones from the University of Edinburgh said the research offered a new way to study the brain.“A better understanding of brain function is important for understanding what makes us human and will also help us treat devastating diseases of the brain like Alzheimer’s disease,” she said. “However, this study is a long way from preserving human brain function after death as portrayed in the cartoon Futurama where heads were kept alive in a jar. It is instead a temporary preservation of some of the more basic cell functions in the pig brain, not the preservation of thought and personality.”"},

On Wednesday morning voting kicked off at 7am local time in restive Papua. It will end at 1pm in Sumatra.Voters are flocking to more than 800,000 polling stations where they will punch holes in ballots – to make clear their candidate choice – and then dip a finger in halal ink, a measure to prevent double-voting.It is the first time  is holding simultaneous presidential and parliamentary elections – a hugely complex logistical undertaking – but it is the presidential race that has consumed much of the nation’s focus.President , a former mayor and furniture salesman from central Java, is up against the fiery nationalist and former army general Prabowo Subianto.Prabowo, the former son-in-law of Indonesia’s longtime ruler Suharto, is running with Sandiaga Uno, a former private equity manager, whilethe president controversially chose Ma’ruf Amin, 76, a conservative Islamic leader, as his vice-presidential running mate.In an election campaign that has been marred by fake news, identity politics and attempts by the candidates to outdo each other in displays of religiosity, Jokowi has for months maintained a double-digit lead over his opponent – if the the country’s most credible polls are to be believed.“I’m excited, we only get to do this once every five years,” said Neneng Kursiah, 37, after completing her ballot at a Jakarta polling booth.“We are for Prabowo in this area, we think he will bring prices of staple foods down and work hard,” said Firman, 42, a voter in Jakarta’s south, chimed in, “But if people want to vote for someone else that’s okay too.”“Should be tight, maybe 50-50 said Bambang Sukanto, a local council worker at a different voting station, “So we are going to watch and make see.”Contemplating whether one of the only true remaining democracies in south-east Asia could be prone to a political upset akin to Brexit, Trump or Duterte, analysts predict Indonesia is likely to buck global trends.“I think Indonesia was ahead of the curve in that aspect of democracy because the anti-establishment outsider, , won in 2014 already,” says an Indonesia analyst, Kevin O’Rourke. “Ironically, the incumbent is the outsider in this race, meanwhile Prabowo Subianto is not the outsider, or anti-establishment figure, he is a quintessential member of the elite.”Jokowi’s 2014 win against Prabowo was hailed as a victory for Indonesia’s young democracy – the first time a figure untethered to the military or political elite had been elected head of state.As president, Jokowi has impressed voters with his commitment to building infrastructure and social welfare, but has drawn criticism for failing to address past human rights abuses and chronic corruption, and most recently for leveraging the state apparatus, including law enforcement agencies and Islamic groups, to solidify his support base.Ayu Dyah Widarti, a volunteer for Jokowi, has spent her morning riding around on her bicycle, checking on the voting process at various polls in Jakarta’s south.“People are enthusiastic, smiling, and it’s been smooth,” she says.Ayu says she is strong supporter of the incumbent. “He has a vision, he in sincere, he works hard, hard, hard. He has high integrity and is honest. And he doesn’t have a problematic background, or any baggage,” she says, “There is already evidence of his leadership, from when he was Solo mayor, Jakarta governor and also a president. He has built a lot of infrastructure and not just for Jakarta, but all over Indonesia, for all Indonesians.”Some voters, disillusioned with the president and also the alternative, a former special forces commander accused of various human rights abuses, have vowed to “”, or abstain, in protest.In the weeks leading up to Wednesday’s vote, the opposition has claimed the integrity of the electoral list is undermined by the existence of millions of “ghost” voters – a move some analysts believe indicates they are laying the groundwork for a legal challenge if they lose.There have been other hiccups, too. A video that circulated last week allegedly showed bags of ballot papers found in Malaysia that were pre-marked for Jokowi. There is also concern about rampant vote buying and the inundation of overseas polling stations in recent days, which have reportedly prevented hundreds from voting, have generated concern.Indonesia’s electoral commission has pledged to investigate, and Wednesday’s election, a government-mandated national holiday, is expected to proceed peacefully and under the watchful eye of voters, thousands of whom plan to monitor the open-air count after the polls close.The polls present a huge logistical challenge in a country stretching 4,800km across more than 17,000 islands, with a population of more than 260 million, home to hundreds of ethnic groups and languages.Officials are moving cardboard ballot boxes by motorbikes, boats and planes – as well as elephants and horses – to reach mountaintop villages and communities deep in the jungle.A series of so-called “quick counts” are expected to give a reliable indication of the presidential winner later on Wednesday. Official results are not expected until May."},

Running on a campaign slogan of “Alberta: Strong and Free”, winner Jason Kenney and his right-wing United Conservative party (UCP) pledged to revive the province’s troubled oil and gas sector, cut taxes and scale back environmental policies enacted by the previous government.“Alberta is open for business,” Kenney told a raucous crowd, after pulling up to the stage of his victory celebration in his blue campaign pickup truck. “Help is on the way and hope is on the horizon.”Premier Rachel Notley of the leftwing New Democratic party was vying for her second mandate in the province of Alberta, having previously shocked the country when she and her party stormed to victory in 2015. The historic win broke an unprecedented 44 years of conservative rule in the province and was heralded as a new age in Alberta politics.But a second time around, her promises of a balance between environmental regulation and businesses growth appears to have been rejected by a majority of Albertans, with frustrated residents defecting to the the UCP. Despite her strong favourability ratings, Notley becomes the first premier in the province’s history to fail to secure a second term. She was the last remaining female premier in the country, a dramatic shift from 2013, when six women held the job in five provinces and one territory. “I am enormously proud of our record – and you should be too,” she told supporters as she conceded the race to Kenney – adding that she would remain as opposition leader. “I wish him and his government well. We all do and we must because we all love Alberta.”With Kenney’s legislative majority, the province appears set to return to the status quo of conservative government.Loud cheers broke out in the Big Four Roadhouse, a venue in the Calgary Stampede grounds where UCP members had gathered. Provisional results at 11pm eastern (0400 GMT Wednesday), an hour after voting ended, showed the party had won 62 of the 87 seats in the provincial legislature.“This means vindication of the very, very difficult defeat that we received in 2015. That was a protest vote, this is a positive vote,” said Marguerite Denis, who co-managed the campaign of one UCP candidate.Much of the bitter campaign centred around pipelines, with both Notley and Kenney vowing to complete the Trans Mountain pipeline, a critical infrastructure project for the province that has  since the summer. A prolonged energy crisis in the province – largely the result of overproduction of oil with no clear access to market – has forced energy companies to sell crude at deep discounts, costing thousands of jobs and billions in lost government tax revenues.While the majority of voters expressed frustration over the economic crisis in the province, they remained skeptical of the socially conservative positions taken by the UCP. Throughout the election Kenney’s party was dogged by accusations of racism and homophobia, promoting candidate resignations and statements of contrition from others.Premier-designate Kenney will have to deliver on promises he made to revitalise the region’s oil sands, something  might be more difficult than anticipated given the high cost of production and a wariness of investing in capital-intensive projects.His victory is the latest in a string of conservative wins at the provincial level since 2015 and spells trouble at the national level for Justin Trudeau and his Liberal government, which has recently fallen in the polls after a political scandal and is locked in multiple legal battles with provinces over the federal carbon tax.Kenney has vowed to scale back the key aspects of the province’s environmental legislation. But any changes to environmental policy that fall below Trudeau’s emissions threshold will trigger the federal government imposition of a carbon tax on the province."},

Not only is it thought to be the first molecular bond, and first chemical compound, to have appeared as the universe cooled after the big bang, but it also opened up the path to the formation of molecules of hydrogen.But while helium hydride was produced in the laboratory almost a century ago, it has proved elusive to detect in space, despite predictions that it should be present in gas clouds in which stars are born, as well as in gas expelled by stars as they die.“Although [helium hydride] is of limited importance on Earth today, the chemistry of the universe began with this ion,” the authors write. “The lack of definitive evidence for its very existence in interstellar space has been a dilemma for astronomy.”Now experts say they have finally spotted helium hydride in a small but bright 600-year-old planetary nebula about 3,000 light years away in the constellation of . While this helium hydride was formed by a different process to that in the early universe, the team say its presence backs up theories of what was going on at the “dawn of chemistry”, bringing a “decades-long search to a happy ending at last”.Dr Jérôme Loreau, an expert in helium hydride from the Université Libre de Bruxelles, who was not involved in the study, said the findings were exciting, noting that although large organic molecules had been found in space, the much simpler helium hydride had proved difficult to track down.“Another reason it is exciting is that HeH+ [helium hydride] is the first molecule ever to form in the universe, about 380,000 years after the big bang, in an era known as the recombination epoch,” said Loreau, adding that molecules that appeared in this period, as the universe cooled, later led to the formation of stars and galaxies. “It is therefore very exciting to have finally observed one of the building blocks of the molecular universe.”One difficulty in detecting helium hydride is that telltale signs based on the light it emits after it is buffeted by electrons tend to be obscured by almost overlapping “signatures” from a different molecule composed of carbon and hydrogen, however, new instruments have turned up trumps., the team report they made their discovery by scrutinising a planetary nebula known as NGC 7027 in which layers of gas are being lost from its hot core – a white dwarf.Data was collected using an instrument onboard a mission known as Sofia, a joint project between Nasa and the German Aerospace Center, in which a specially modified Boeing 747SP aircraft is flown very high up in the Earth’s atmosphere, up to about 13,700 metres (45,000ft), carrying a 2.7-metre telescope and other instruments. At this height, the instruments are above the vast majority of the Earth’s water vapour, which would otherwise obscure signals from other molecules.Crucially, these instruments offer a very high resolution, allowing light from helium hydride to be distinguished from signatures of other molecules at very similar wavelengths.Prof Phillip Stancil, an expert on helium hydride from the University of Georgia, also said the discovery was exciting, but pointed out only one “signature” of helium hydride was detected, and two are usually needed to be sure.But Dr Rolf Güsten, from the Max Planck Institute for Radio  in Bonn, Germany, and first author of the research, said the chance of the identification being wrong is negligible, adding that the findings resolve a longstanding conundrum.“The lack of evidence of the very existence of helium hydride in the local universe has called into question our understanding of the chemistry in the early universe,” he said. “The detection reported here resolves such doubts.”"},

Racial animosity, Mohammedan feeling about the downfall of Turkey, the prevailing high prices everywhere, and the vague political ideas about self-determination may all be considered as contributory causes, and the Rowlatt Bills have been used as handle mainly by the irreconcilables, whose almost openly avowed creed has always been dislike of the British Raj.The movement purports to be “one of passive resistance only, avoiding all violence and soul force is to triumph over the brute force that crams such legislation down the throats of an unwilling people.” The very first manifestation of the movement at Delhi began by the forcible closing of the shops of people, who knew nothing and cared less about the bills, and ended by a violent resistance to authority which is in direct opposition to the vow taken by Mr Gandhi and his supporters."},

Infertility and in-breeding have been long-term issues for the birds’ reproductive efforts.But this year 76 kākāpō chicks have hatched and 60 are expected to make it to adulthood, the result of heavy seeding in the New Zealand bush that has produced an abundance of the bird’s favourite food: fruit from the Rimu tree, a southern species of conifer.Forty-nine out of 50 breeding females laid eggs this year. , when 37 chicks fledged.I talk about the  of two of the world's rarest and most unusual birds. Come for the weird bird videos and pics; stay for the science!    “It’s absolutely huge, it’s massive,” said Dr Andrew Digby, a science advisor to the Department of Conservation’s kākāpō recovery programme.“In the last two seasons there have been huge quantities of fruit not seen for 50 years, so that’s why all of the female kākāpō know it is time to breed, and actually started much earlier than usual, meaning some have now been able to nest twice.”Digby says his team give kākāpō “no privacy” during the critical breeding season.“I can be anywhere in the world and log in and find out which kākāpo mated last night, who they mated with, how long they mated for, the quality of the mating – its real big brother stuff,” he said.Conservation efforts also include an , artificial insemination techniques, and supplementary feeding trials to optimise productivity.“We have to be intensive at the moment,” said Digby.Every kākāpō in New Zealand has a smart transmitter attached to its body, and remote monitoring systems are embedded in their nests. Rangers also check chicks every night while they are growing, and there are currently seven chicks being hand-reared by DoC staff.The chicks are being raised on two predator free islands off the coast of New Zealand, on protected sanctuaries that are pest-free, but eventually the kākāpō recovery team would like to reintroduce them to mainland New Zealand’s bush, cities and towns.The population would have to get up to “at least 500” for the scientists to think about backing off, Digby says.“When you’ve only got a population of 147 anything could wipe them out and they could become extinct quite quickly. We want to get 150 breeding females, and ideally some unmanaged populations, before we can start to relax a little bit.”Kākāpō were once thought to be extinct until a population was found in the 1970s on Stewart Island, at the bottom of the country.

{"title": "Victor Hugo's Notre Dame novel tops bestseller list after fire", "time": "Wed 17 Apr 2019 ", "category": "Europe", "tags": "Notre Dame,France,Paris,Victor Hugo,Europe,news", "content": "Victor Hugo’s 19th-century literary classic Notre-Dame de Paris has soared to the top of France’s online bestseller list after the fire that ravaged the 850-year-old  cathedral on Monday night.By Wednesday morning, different editions of the 1831 novel occupied the first, third, fifth, seventh and eighth slots in Amazon France’s bestseller list, with a history of the gothic architectural masterpiece taking sixth place.The book is better known in the Anglosphere as The Hunchback of , the title given to its 1833 English translation.The runaway success confirms a French tendency to seek solace in literature at times of national anguish: , Ernest Hemingway’s memoir of his time in the bars and cafés of 1920s Paris, became France’s fastest-selling book after the terror attacks of November 2015.Hugo’s epic 11-volume novel is set in 1482 and tells the story of the beautiful Gypsy girl Esmeralda, who captures the hearts of many men – but especially the hunchback Quasimodo, the half-blind and deaf bellringer of Notre-Dame.Many critics have argued that the  is the real hero of the work, which the writer and campaigner began in 1829 partly to draw attention to the importance of the French capital’s gothic architecture, which at the time was being widely neglected, defaced or pulled down to make way for new buildings.The novel went on to become a classic and is largely credited with helping to initiate a vast renovation of the crumbling cathedral – Hugo’s “majestic and sublime edifice” – in the mid-19th century, completed by the architects Jean-Baptiste-Antoine Lassus and Eugène Viollet-le-Duc.In one often-cited passage from the novel, Hugo rages at the state of the building: “As much beauty as it may retain in its old age, it is not easy to repress a sigh, to restrain our anger, when we mark the countless defacements and mutilations to which men and time have subjected that venerable monument.”A second, equally prophetic passage has circulated widely on social media in France since the fire that  of the cathedral’s roof and sent its spire toppling into the nave.“All eyes were turned to the top of the church,” Hugo wrote. “What they saw was most strange. Upon the top of the topmost gallery, higher than the central rose-window, a vast flame ascended between the two belfries with whirling sparks.“A vast flame, fierce and strong, fragments of which were borne away by the wind with the smoke. Below this flame … two spouts, terminating in gargoyles, vomited sheets of fiery rain, whose silvery streams shone out distinctly against the gloom of the lower part of the cathedral front.”"},

What? Who? How?” tweeted Nuha Dadesh, one resident. “And I can also hear jets in the air. I can’t decide how far or close they are, but I don’t wanna know.” tweeted he was in touch with his family close to the areas being struck.“Tonight it was a close call, the areas hit keep getting only blocks away from where my family resides. We suffered hits and damage in 2011, 2014, 2018. I hope to god not again. I spent the entire night just messaging my family to make sure they are ok.”The government in Tripoli denounced Haftar’s attacks as barbaric, adding: “The indiscriminate attacks showed his forces lacked a shred of humanity.”The prime minister, Fayez al-Sarraj, visited some of the sites struck by missiles after which he called for three days of mourning. He said evidence of the brutal attacks on civilian neighbourhoods would be handed to the international criminal court (ICC).The UN special envoy for , Ghassan Salamé, tweeted: “A horrible night of random shelling of residential areas. For the sake of 3 million citizens in Greater Tripoli, these attacks should stop now.”The government said it would try to launch counter-assaults against Haftar’s Libyan National Army in eastern Libya by trying to seize back control of the city of Benghazi. It also claimed to be attacking the Haftar forces’ supply lines to the south of Tripoli.The LNA denied responsibility for the attacks, but street demonstrations in Tripoli blamed Haftar. The government is likely to lose support in the densely populated capital if it cannot protect civilians from Haftar’s missiles.The descriptions of the strikes suggest the use of ground-launched missiles known to be in Haftar’s arsenal after his forces showed off BM 21 multiple launch rocket systems and Scud B launchers at a parade last year.Analysts were, however divided whether the barrage was the precursor to a wider assault on Tripoli by Haftar’s fighters or evidence that the fighting was settling into a bloody stalemate.So far, government appeals to world leaders to press Haftar to end his assault have been ineffective, even though its call has support in Italy, the UK and Germany.Italy is leading the mediation efforts to secure a ceasefire, and is concerned that a prolonged civil war could lead to tens of thousands of refugees and migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.Libya is on the brink of an all-out civil war that threatens to upend years of diplomatic efforts to reconcile two rival armed political factions. An advance led by Khalifa Haftar, the warlord from the east of the country, has diplomats scrambling and the UN appealing in vain for a truce. The , the European power closest to Haftar, insists it had no prior warning of his assault, which is closing in on the capital, Tripoli. The outcome could shape not just the politics of Libya, but also the security of the Mediterranean, and the relevance of democracy across the Middle East and north Africa.For more about the fighting in Libya .Matteo Salvini, the far-right Italian interior minister, kept up his coded attacks on the French support for Haftar, saying: “Someone tried a blitz in Libya. It didn’t go well. Someone certainly supported this blitz, not Italy. The Italian government is working as a firefighter. Let’s hope that there are not just a few of us doing that. Let’s hope that the international community helps is to restore peace to the centre of Libya’s objectives.”Fatou Bensouda, the chief prosecutor at the ICC, said she would bring charges against those responsible for humanitarian crimes including attacks on civilians. In a statement, she said: “I remind all parties that any person who incites or engages in such crimes including by ordering, requesting, encouraging or contributing in any other manner to the commission of crimes within the jurisdiction of the court is liable to prosecution.”The government largely has the support of the UN special envoy, who believes that the attack on Tripoli has been timed deliberately to torpedo his plan to stage a national reconciliation conference this week. The conference, which is designed to pave the way for unification of government and institutions across eastern and western Libya, has been postponed.The UK, which is lead state on drafting decisions on the Libya at the UN security council,  for a UN resolution calling for a ceasefire, but is struggling because of objections expressed by a range of countries including Russia.The US approach to the crisis has also become more ambiguous in recent days, with senior state department officials increasingly reluctant to condemn Haftar by name, and stressing that Libya needs security, and an end to militia rule.In a sign of the international tensions surrounding Libya, which has huge oil resources, a LNA spokesman denounced the Gulf state of Qatar for its “insolent intrusion into Libyan politics”. He was referring to a Qatari call for the UN arms embargo on the government to be lifted, or enforced properly on all sides.The LNA has accused Qatar ever since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 of financially backing Islamist militia that are strong in Tripoli and Misrata, Libya’s third largest city.The LNA said: “We demand that Qatar cease meddling in Libyan affairs. The Qatari phase in Libyan affairs is now over and they will never control the resources of the Libyan people. We will destroy Qatari ambitions in Libya. Qatar will not be able to control oil and gas resources in Libya. We will punish the countries that have supported terrorism. We have the ability to punish whoever we want whenever we want.”The LNA has largely been supported by the United Arab Emirates and the Saudi Arabia, states that  have been involved in a power struggle with Qatar.Qatar’s deputy prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, told the Italian daily La Repubblica that the  should be rescheduled and Haftar’s army made to withdraw. The arms embargo must be implemented “to prevent those countries that have been providing ammunitions and state-of-the-art weapons from continuing to do so”, he said."},

You can’t smell the product,” she said. “It’s too expensive.”And so she, like tens of thousand of other Canadians, went back to their old habits: buying from neighbourhood dealers.Six months after  became the first G7 country to legalise marijuana, the bold experiment is still struggling to get off the ground.Legal producers were unable to meet the sudden surge in demand, and struggled for weeks to fill orders, leaving marijuana stores with .As a result, the vast majority of cannabis sales in the country – roughly $5bn – are made on the illegal markets, compared to $2bn in legal sales, according to government figures from January 2019.Ahead of legalization, the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, had argued that the move would nearly , which he said funnelled money into organized crime.But with so little cannabis to sell, licensed operators across the country have had to turn away potential customers, sending them instead to the black market.“When I’m sold out, they’re still gonna find a product somewhere,” said Trevor Tobin, who operates the High North marijuana store in Labrador with his mother, Brenda.Tobin said running a legal cannabis business has been an “ongoing struggle” in the face of persistent shortages. “It’s hard to keep employees behind the counter when they’re not selling any product – and we lose money every day that we don’t have product on the shelf.”The Tobins are also competing against illegal “grey market” stores, which alongside marijuana sell edibles and hashish – items that licensed stores cannot yet offer.A number of government outlets and licensed private stores have also faced complaints that their products do not match the quality of the black market.“The product I got smelt like barn hay and was just as dry,” on the site , reviewing Toronto’s first bricks-and-mortar locations, The Hunny Pot. “The only reason I’ll go back is to get a refund for this purchase.”Melissa agreed: “I found it was really dry. And you feel like you’re getting less as a result. It kind of feels like you’re getting ripped off.” Even her friend, who works at a government store, gets his cannabis from an illegal supplier.Canadians who purchase their cannabis from illegal sources also save a significant amount of money: the average price for a gram of illegal cannabis is 36% cheaper than its legal counterpart, Statistics Canada .“As long as that price differential exists, there will likely be a black market – because people will go to where they can get a deal,” said Rosalie Wynoch, a policy analyst at the CD Howe Institute, a conservative thinktank. “The government was aware that it wouldn’t fully displace the black market on day one.” She and others suspect the black market will persist for at least another two years, as it did when Colorado legalised cannabis.Canada is still grappling with how to treat people convicted under the country’s previous laws.The  500,000 Canadians with minor cannabis convictions – but the current rules are still not enough, said Murray Rankin of the New Democratic party and member of the parliamentary justice committee.Rankin has become a vocal advocate of expunging the records of those with convictions. “The niceties of the human rights legislation may not be something you’re aware of,” he said. “Even if you were the victim of discrimination, tell me how many people are going to go to the human rights commission with their complaint and deal with it? Frankly not that many.”Rankin also points to the uncomfortable reality of policing in Canada:  in the number of minor cannabis convictions.“The disproportionate impact on the hundreds of thousands of Canadians … is something that really should motivate us to not just do the half measure the government’s talked about, but fully expunge so people can get on with their lives,” he said.Canada will begin the second stage of legalization – the sale of edibles and cannabis-infused drinks – in October."},
{"title": "Notre Dame fire: Macron promises to rebuild cathedral within five years", "time": "Wed 17 Apr 2019 ", "category": "Europe", "tags": "Notre Dame,Paris,France,Europe,news", "content": "Emmanuel Macron has announced he wants to see  cathedral rebuilt “more beautiful than before” within five years, but there are warnings that the repairs could take decades and will involve substantial challenges.The main problems include the sourcing of materials and painstaking work to preserve elements of the church that have survived the fire but might have been badly damaged by it, experts have warned.Eric Fischer, who heads a foundation restoring the 1,000-year-old Strasbourg Cathedral that recently underwent a three-year facelift, said he thought rebuilding Notre Dame would probably take several decades.“The damage will be significant,” Fischer said.Audrey Azoulay, director-general of Unesco, the UN’ cultural organisation, said restoring Notre Dame “will last a long time and cost a lot of money”.Donations have poured in from around the world for the restoration efforts, with more than €800m (£692m) pledged as French tycoons and global corporations announced they would donate.“The fire at Notre Dame reminds us that our history never stops and we will always have challenges to overcome,” Macron said on Tuesday night. “We will rebuild Notre Dame, more beautiful than before – and I want it done in the next five years. We can do it. After the time of testing comes a time of reflection and then of action.”French authorities revealed on Tuesday that the cathedral was within “15 to 30 minutes” of complete destruction as firefighters battled to stop flames reaching its gothic bell towers.A greater disaster was averted by members of the  fire brigade, who risked their lives to remain inside the burning monument to create a wall of water between the raging fire and two towers on the west facade.The revelation of how close France came to losing its most famous cathedral emerged as police investigators  in the restoration of the monument to try to establish the cause of the devastating blaze. prosecutor Remy Heitz saidthat an initial fire alert was sounded at 6:20pm on Monday evening but no fire was found. The second alert was sounded at 6:43pm, and the blaze was discovered on the roof.Despite fears at the height of the inferno that the whole cathedral would be lost, the structure appears mainly intact.Tom Nickson, a senior lecturer in medieval art and architecture at London’s Courtauld Institute, said the stone vault “acted as a kind of fire door between the highly flammable roof and the highly flammable interior” just as the cathedral’s medieval builders intended.There are fears that the stones of the ceiling and beloved stained glass windows, which survived the blaze, may still have been badly damaged by it. If the stones of the vaulted ceiling have been weakened and cracked by the heat, the whole vault may need to be torn down and re-erected.The cathedral’s exquisite stained-glass rose windows are probably suffering “thermal shock” from intense heat followed by cold water, said Jenny Alexander, an expert on medieval art and architecture at the University of Warwick. That means the glass, set in lead, could have sagged or been weakened and will need minute examination.The first challenge for repairers will be to secure the building without disturbing the debris. “Some of that material may be reusable, and that’s a painstaking exercise. It’s like an archaeological excavation,” said Duncan Wilson, chief executive of the conservation organisation Historic England.Once the building has been stabilised and the damage assessed, restoration work can begin. It is likely to be an international effort.“Structural engineers, stained-glass experts, stone experts are all going to be packing their bags and heading for Paris in the next few weeks,” Alexander said.Financial and political considerations, as well as aesthetic ones, are likely to play a part in the decision about whether to preserve the cathedral as it was before the fire, or adapt it.Getting materials may also be a challenge. The cathedral roof was made from oak beams cut from centuries-old trees, which were difficult to source even in the 13th century. Nickson said there is probably no country in  with big enough trees today.Then there is the question of conforming to modern-day health and safety standards.The roof of Strasbourg’s Notre Dame was set ablaze during the 1870 Franco-Prussian War. Nowadays the roof is split into three fire-resistant sections to make sure one blaze can’t destroy it all, with smoke detectors installed are at regular intervals.“Cathedrals are stone phoenixes reminders that out of adversity we may be reborn,” said Emma Wells, a buildings archaeologist at the University of York.“The silver lining, if we can call it that, is this allows for historians and archaeologists to come in and uncover more of its history than we ever knew before. It is a palimpsest of layers of history, and we can come in and understand the craft of our medieval forebears.”"},

He has built a lot of infrastructure and not just for Jakarta, but all over , for all Indonesians.”As president, Jokowi has impressed voters with his commitment to building infrastructure and expanding social welfare, but has drawn criticism for failing to address past human rights abuses and chronic corruption, and most recently for leveraging the state apparatus, including law enforcement agencies and Islamic groups, to solidify his support base.In the lead-up to the election some voters, disillusioned with the president and also unimpressed with the challenger, a former general accused of human rights abuses including in East Timor, had vowed to “”, or abstain, in protest.Opinion on who should lead the country appeared divided in the capital on Wednesday, with many voters saying they would remain at polling stations to watch the open-air vote count and ensure it was transparent. “Should be tight, maybe 50/50,” said Bambang Sukanto, a council worker, at one polling station. “So we are going to watch and see.”In one of the only remaining democratic bright spots in south-east Asia, the election campaign has been marked by a deluge of fake news, and in the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation, attempts by the candidates to outdo each other in displays of religiosity.While Jokowi has for months maintained a double-digit lead, there had been a feeling on the ground that it could be a closer race than predicted. In the bitterly divisive , he defeated Prabowo by 6 percentage points.Despite the quick count results, the Prabowo camp is claiming its exit poll shows the former general won with 55.4%.In recent months the opposition has also claimed the integrity of the electoral list is undermined by the existence of millions of “ghost” voters – a move some analysts believe indicates it is laying the groundwork for a legal challenge if Prabowo loses.Speaking to reporters near his home in Bogor, West Java, after voting, he said he could not guarantee there would not be any post-election chaos, but said it would not come from his team.“I promise that we will work for the good of the country. If it’s chaos, it’s not from us, that I guarantee,” Prabowo said. “But, we don’t want to be cheated any more. People don’t want to be cheated any more.”Across the archipelago there were also several logistical hiccups. In some areas of West Papua ballot papers did not reach remote areas in time, with the vote in several subdistricts postponed until Thursday.And after a video was circulated last week allegedly showing bags of ballots pre-marked for Jokowi in Kuala Lumpur, the elections commission has announced voting there will be rescheduled, while an inundated overseas polling station in Sydney will be reopened after hundreds of voters missed out."},

The issue has on occasion been a source of friction between some feminist and LGBT groups.The manifesto also promises to introduce equal parental leave, of 16 weeks, for men and women, and to revise the sexual offences law to make the issue of positive consent – yes means yes – the deciding factor.Meanwhile, Spain’s rightwing parties have tried to appeal to men who they say are being undermined by feminism. In last December’s regional elections in Andalucía, Javier Ortega Smith, the secretary general of the far-right Vox party, demanded that gender violence laws be scrapped, claiming they discriminated against men.Santiago Abascal, Vox’s leader, called for an end to subsidies going to what he called “radical feminist groups” and the scrapping of the gender violence law in favour of a new law against “family violence that protects the elderly, men, women and children equally”.Pablo Casado, the leader of the conservative People’s party, provoked an outcry among some Spanish women when he appealed to traditional Catholic voters, declaring: “Women should know that what they carry inside them is another life.”“Thanks for clearing that up, Pablo,” one woman tweeted. “I thought I was carrying a Kinder egg.”Justifying his party’s refusal to support the international women’s day march on 8 March, in which hundreds of thousands of women took part, Casado said it was designed “to provoke a confrontation between men and women and to divide them”.Albert Rivera, the leader of the centre-right Citizens party, advised the Podemos party leader, Pablo Iglesias, who recently became the father of twins, that “sometimes you have to pretend to be asleep to avoid changing nappies”.The PSOE pledge to abolish prostitution would require a change in the law as, while pimping and trafficking are illegal in , prostitution is not.There are an estimated 100,000 sex workers in Spain, in a trade worth around €3.5bn (£3bn) a year. Police and NGOs estimate around 80% of sex workers have been trafficked.Surveys suggest around 39% of Spanish men have paid for sex, a far higher proportion than in the majority of European countries."},

The official cited a judge who gave “private reasons” for the postponement and no new date for the hearing was set.Foreign media and diplomats – already barred from attending previous sessions in the high-profile trial – were turned away from Riyadh’s criminal court. A panel of three judges had been expected to examine the response already submitted by the detainees to the charges against them.It follows further arrests of the women’s family members and supporters this month, in a sign that Riyadh is not bending to international pressure over its treatment of political prisoners.The women on trial, all active campaigners in the fight to end the country’s guardianship system that renders women second-class citizens, were arrested last May, just before Crown Prince  lifted the longstanding ban on women driving. Among the charges they face are allegations of spying and harming Saudi interests by contacting foreign media, diplomats and human rights groups.Since their arrest the Guardian has seen leaked medical reports saying that several of the women are suffering from malnutrition, cuts, bruises and burns, evidence which appears to contradict the authorities’ insistence that men and women in their custody are not being tortured.Hathloul’s family have  during nearly a year in custody.The allegations have fuelled criticism of the kingdom’s human rights record, already under intense scrutiny after the  at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last year. While the royal family has acknowledged that a team of Saudi operatives killed the journalist inside the diplomatic mission in October, they have described the incident as a rogue operation carried out without the involvement of the crown prince.Khashoggi’s death is believed to have led King Salman to order a review of the decision to arrest and detain about 200 men and women in a crackdown ordered by his son and heir Prince Mohammed. The medical reports viewed by the Guardian were part of recommendations made by the investigation to pardon all the prisoners or at least allow an early release for those suffering from serious health problems.Three of the detained women – Yousef, Nafjan and the academic Dr Rokaya Mohareb – . The case has also been transferred from a high-security terrorism court to a criminal court, steps taken after lobbying efforts from human rights groups and western governments.However, at least 14 more people believed to be supportive of the women, including academics and writers, were arrested earlier in April. Among the new detainees was Yousef’s son, Salah al-Haidar. Haidar and another new detainee are dual US citizens, and one detainee is pregnant.The Saudi government has so far not publicly commented on the latest crackdown and the new detainees’ whereabouts are unknown. Last Wednesday, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said he had pressed , a close ally of Donald Trump’s administration, to release the US citizens.Prince Mohammed has ushered in sweeping social reforms in Saudi Arabia since he was appointed heir to the throne in 2017. Curbing the powers of the country’s notorious religious police and reintroducing cinemas and public entertainment has been accompanied by a sustained crackdown on intellectuals, businesspeople, clerics and rivals considered a threat to his power."},

The changes have been overseen by the country’s billionaire sultan, Hassanal Bolkiah, who has described them as a “great achievement”.This month the Brunei-owned Dorchester hotel in London was  for the Police Federation’s bravery awards over the controversy.The College of Policing – a professional body for police in England and Wales – has earned millions providing training for overseas regimes since its inception in 2012, including several  such as Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE.Its 10-week strategic leadership programme “involves visits to key policing institutions in the UK and mainland Europe, and extensive research in UK police forces,” according to a course synopsis. “The philosophy of the programme is to provide rich opportunities for self-directed, personal and professional development in a stimulating and supportive team environment which mirrors the culture of a world-class ‘top team’.”The veteran gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, who has  with the sultan of Brunei’s regime, said: “Even before the enactment of these new extremist sharia laws, Brunei was a quasi-dictatorship without international standards of democracy and human rights. It is shocking to think that some of these officers may now be involved in enforcing the death penalty for homosexuality, adultery and insulting the prophet Mohammad.“I’m surprised that the College of Policing has previously agreed to train Brunei police, given the country’s longstanding tyranny. Its decision to refuse such training in the future is welcome and long overdue.”College of Policing officials were given a series of Brunei-related gifts in December 2012, including a £510 Swiss-made men’s watch. The watch, which was given by a senior superintendent in Brunei’s police force, was accepted but sold at auction to raise money for charity.Other gifts included two £5 Brunei baseball caps, a £15 Brunei “swagger stick” – a short stick carried by an officer – and two Brunei police tie pins worth a total of £5. A £10 plaque depicting Brunei’s policing rank structure was also handed over.The gifts were all retained by the college’s office, apart from the swagger stick which was kept by the recipient. In return, the College of Policing gave two £5 metal notepads and two £5 Parker pens.A College of Policing spokesman explained that staff were not allowed to keep gifts worth more than £25, adding: “It is common for police forces to share token gifts and souvenirs when travelling internationally and we publish a register of gifts on our website each quarter.”The College of Policing’s deputy chief constable, Bernie O’Reilly, said: “All training delivered by the College of Policing is consistent with the British model of policing by consent and respect for human rights and dignity is interwoven into our courses. We have consideration for our code of ethics and human rights before any decision is made to deliver training to police forces overseas.“In light of recent legislative changes in Brunei we will not be undertaking any training in the country if a request is made.”Brunei, which has a population of 430,000 people, is situated on the island of Borneo and gained full independence from Britain in 1984.A senior official in Brunei’s foreign ministry said: “The decision of the College of Policing is certainly highly regrettable. The cooperation over the years is much appreciated. Their decision is respected and certainly there is no intention to politicise the issue further.” "},

But since prosecutors in Sicily announced the arrest, serious doubts have been raised about the man’s identity.A  by the Swedish broadcaster SVT, in collaboration with the Guardian, concluded Mered was “living it up” in Uganda, while the arrested man, a refugee whose name is Medhanie Tesfamariam Berhe, was delivered to authorities in Italy. taken from Mered’s three-year-old son and from Berhe’s mother also suggest it is a case of mistaken identity.The prosecutor’s office in Palermo continues to insist the arrested man is Mered, despite the fact it has not been able to provide a single witness to testify against him in the past three years. One of the officers, Elsadeg Elnour Adbelrahman, admitted being a member of Niss and said he had met NCA agents in Khartoum in May 2016.“We were told we had to arrest a man who was accused of human trafficking,” he said. “They gave us a picture and a phone number. We have just executed the order. The detainee told us he was not the trafficker Medhanie Yedhego Mered, but called himself Medhanie Tesfamariam Berhe. He also said he was a refugee and that a trafficker had asked him for $1,800 to reach .”The judge asked the other officer whether the search of the detainee and his interrogation had taken place in the presence of a lawyer. Lt Amir Ibrahim Abdelsadig Mahmoud said: “The presence of a lawyer can be required by Sudanese law, but we did not think to ask the detainee if he needed one.”At the end of the hearing, Berhe described being tortured by Sudanese police officers.“They beat me when they arrested me, beat me in prison,” he said. “They blocked me with a heavy chain and tried to take off my clothes and do bad things to me. I had an ID card with me from Eritrea and a document from the refugee camp when I was in Ethiopia.“But they took everything. I had a little money with me and they took that too. They told me if I’d had more money, they would have released me.”Berhe’s lawyer, Michele Calantropo, told the Guardian: “Today in court, we heard the testimony of a member of one of the most brutal police bodies in the world about how he had arrested my client. I think there is nothing to add.”Riccardo Noury, a spokesman for Amnesty International in , said: “In the last days, Niss has been involved in the brutal crackdown on the Sudanese protesters. The fact that today, in an Italian court, a member of Niss was speaking before a judge is totally unacceptable.”In the past week, as more than 30,000 signatures have been gathered in favour of Berhe’s release, hundreds of people have been protesting in Oslo, Stockholm, London and Frankfurt, calling for Italian authorities to release the arrested man. They are all Eritreans and many of them were trafficked to Europe by Mered, who appears to be still on the run."},

Critics fear storing the personal data of users in Russia would allow the Kremlin’s security services to access information on opposition activists.Facebook said in November that it had 6.2 million users in Russia, a number dwarfed by the 70 million Russians who use VKontakte, the country’s most popular social networking website.VKontakte’s founder, Pavel Durov, was forced to give up control of the company after backing street protests against Putin in 2011-12. It is now owned by the Mail.ru group, which belongs to the Kremlin-friendly billionaire Alisher Usmanov.Russia has also attempted, with limited success, to block Telegram, the messaging service set up by Durov in 2013. It continues to be widely used, including by senior Russian government officials who are reported to use VPNs (virtual private networks) to get around the ban. Officials last month threatened to block popular VPNs unless they agreed to restrict access to websites banned by Russia.Zharov’s comments came shortly after Russia’s parliament approved a bill that would allow Moscow to cut off the country’s internet traffic from foreign servers. Critics say the move would lead to greater censorship, while the authors of the bill say it is aimed at making Russia’s internet less vulnerable to cyberwarfare."},

The ban came “due to the negative effects caused by some electronic games on the health, culture, and security of Iraqi society, including societal and moral threats to children and youth”, the text of the resolution read.Oil-rich Iraq suffered for decades under the dictatorial rule of Saddam Hussein and UN sanctions, the 2003 US invasion and civil war it unleashed, and the battle against Isis, over which Baghdad declared victory in 2017.

He said an estimation of the cost of rebuilding the cathedral had yet to be made. French billionaires, multinationals and private citizens have so far raised €880m (£762m) for the restoration.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, promised the nation on Tuesday night that Notre Dame  – and be “more beautiful than before” – within five years, a timetable many experts consider impossible.Notre Dame’s rector said he expected the building to remain closed to the public for five to six years. “A segment has been very weakened,” said Bishop Patrick Chauvet.A fire service spokesman said there was no immediate danger that the structure, which lost two-thirds of its roof in the fire, would collapse. But it was not yet considered secure enough for investigators to enter and start , the prosecutor’s office said.Investigators, who have said they have no reason to believe the blaze was anything but an accident, spoke to about 30 witnesses on Tuesday, including employees of companies involved in a €150m restoration programme that is widely believed to be linked to the fire.A fire brigade official, Philippe Demay, said the cathedral’s twin towers would have collapsed if the 400 firefighters on the scene had not moved fast and brought in the right heavy equipment. The operation was “extremely difficult”, he said, denying the service could have acted any faster than it did.On Wednesday evening cathedral bells rang out across  at the exact time the devastating blaze struck on Monday, after the Conference of French Bishops said they would ring nationwide in “solidarity with the diocese of Paris”. was built over a period of nearly 200 years, starting in the middle of the 12th century, but the 93-metre lead-covered spire was only added in the mid-19th century, during a major restoration project completed by the architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc.“The international competition will allow us to ask the question of whether we should even recreate the spire as it was conceived by Viollet-le-Duc,” Philippe told reporters after a cabinet meeting dedicated to the fire.“Or, as is often the case in the evolution of heritage, whether we should endow Notre Dame with a new spire. This is obviously a huge challenge, a historic responsibility.”The prime minister said the government would present a bill next week to ensure “transparency and good management” during the reconstruction project, including measures to make sure all donations actually end up going to Notre Dame. Ordinary French citizens will benefit from a tax break of 75% on donations up to €1,000.Architects have identified three main holes in the structure: where the spire formerly stood, in the transept, and the vault of the north transept. But a  fire service spokesman, Gabriel Plus, said on Wednesday the cathedral’s renowned rose windows were in good condition, although there was a risk for the gables in which they were set because these were “no longer supported by the frame”.Statues inside the gables had been taken down as a precautionary measure to reduce the load on the weakened structure, Plus said. The spire’s bronze rooster, long a symbol of France, was found on Tuesday, deformed by the heat and battered by its fall but nonetheless recognisable.Many other priceless artefacts inside the cathedral were also saved, including the Crown of Thorns, seen as Notre Dame’s most sacred relic, and the famous 18th-century organ that boasts more than 8,000 pipes. Some paintings and other artworks will be restored at the Louvre after sustaining smoke and water damage.Stéphane Bern, the government’s culture representative, said on Wednesday that €880m had been raised for the restoration so far, with contributors including Apple, the Total energy group and tycoons who own luxury French brands such as L’Oréal, Chanel, Dior and Louis Vuitton. Many private individuals in France and around the world have also donated.Experts have said Macron’s five-year timetable, which would see the rebuilding completed by the 2024 Paris Olympics, is highly ambitious. One leading French conservation architect, Pierluigi Pericolo, told French media it was “a colossal task” that would take “no less than 15 years”.Pericolo, who worked on the restoration of the 19th-century Nantes basilica, which was badly damaged by fire in 2015, said it could take between two and five years just to check the stability of the weakened edifice. “It’s a fundamental step, and very complex, because it’s difficult to send workers into a monument whose vaulted ceilings are swollen with water,” he told French radio.“The end of the fire doesn’t mean the edifice is totally saved. The stone can deteriorate when it is exposed to high temperatures and change its mineral composition and fracture inside.”Companies specialising in the restoration of historic buildings and monuments also warned they would have trouble finding enough skilled workers and apprentices.“We’ll have to recruit 100 masons, 150 woodworkers and 200 roofers,” said Jean-Claude Bellanger of the artisans’ organisation the Compagnons du Devoir. “The problem is that these manual crafts are undervalued and don’t attract many people. We have the firms and the expertise, but there’s a serious lack of young people for this work.”Shopkeepers and cafe and restaurant owners in the vicinity of the cathedral have said they too are worried about their futures.

In the article (, 13 April), I clearly mentioned that Indians killed five British civilians. What Masani does not mention was that this came after British troops, panicking as the mob threw stones, opened fire without warning, injuring between 20 and 30, of whom 15 died. It was this that led to further violence. I also mentioned that a female British missionary was assaulted. But again, Masani does not mention that General Dyer ordered that Indians crossing the street where she was attacked must crawl on all fours.Masani also claims that the British intended to grant India dominion status. Perhaps he has not read the war cabinet minutes of 14 August 1917 which promised India “gradual development of self-governing institutions”. Lord Curzon, who piloted this measure, had told the cabinet it was “the wildest of dreams” that India would ever become a self-governing dominion like the white dominions of Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa. He was certain that in the “march towards the self-governing ideal, the political unity of  … would disappear altogether if the protecting power were withdrawn; and no language should be used that might … encourage such a belief”.Balfour, in his memo, warned the cabinet that because Indians were not the same race as the British they could never manage the sort of self-government institutions “along the same lines to that which has been set up in Canada, Australasia and the Cape”. Nor, said Balfour, could he see Indians ever be educated to manage it as “education cannot fundamentally alter the material on which it works”.As Sir Penderel Moon puts it in his classic The British Conquest and Dominion of India: “The goal for India as defined in August 1917 did not, therefore, imply India would become a wholly independent state. As part of the Empire there would be still be some limitations on her sovereignty.”As for the House of Commons condemning the massacre, Masani does not mention that the debate took place on the motion to reduce the salary of Edwin Montagu, the secretary of state for India, by £100 – reflecting those members who disagreed with the view that Dyer’s action was a “monstrosity” and “un-British”. Montagu won, but 129 members voted against the government. In the Lords the government lost, and nobody reading Hansard can have any doubt that Dyer was viewed as a hero by many in the Commons and the Lords.Masani is perfectly entitled to defend the , but he cannot gloss over the fact that it was based on European racial supremacy. The support for Dyer was based on the idea that in a contest between a European and a non-European they must always support the European even if he was in the wrong."},

Emmanuel Macron’s address to the nation in response to months of protest and violence from the  (yellow vests) movement and the “great national debate” they sparked had been recorded that afternoon and was due to go live at 8pm.Running to 26 minutes, it was, said Le Monde, “a make-or-break moment for the presidency and for this president, confronted […] with one of the most serious social crises the country has known for 30 years”.But just before 7pm, the first flames began licking the roof of Notre Dame Cathedral. After a moment’s hesitation, Macron pulled the broadcast,  “at seeing a part of us all burn this evening”.Three hours later, he was on the steps of the cathedral, telling a shell-shocked nation that  was France’s “history, our literature, the epicentre of our life, the cathedral of every French person”, and promising to rebuild it, “because it is what our history deserves, and it is our destiny”.Analysts said that the dramatic blaze, and the extraordinary national outpouring of emotion that it provoked, could prove both a boon and a threat to the reformist, pro-business Macron, whose presidency was for a while on the ropes over the  crisis.“On the one hand, it’s been good for Macron,” said one leading analyst, François Heisbourg of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. “He showed he had the right reflexes in postponing his planned speech, and this catastrophe certainly offers him the chance to play the presidential role of bringing the nation together.”However, Heisbourg said, the sheer force of public reaction to the great cathedral’s partial destruction revealed “a country that has suffered an accumulation of traumas.  is, politically and socially, in a very fragile state”. This had significantly raised the stakes for the speech on the  when Macron finally delivers it, he said.Bruno Cautrès of Cevipof, the centre for political research at Paris’s prestigious Sciences Po university, said the young president’s reaction to the blaze had “above all shown how he intends to deal with, and move on from, the  crisis”.Macron’s emphasis on a profound, long-term transformation of France could ultimately be well served by the disaster, Cautrès argued.“He may be able to use it to consolidate his core arguments: the call for peace and unity, the overriding need to get the country pulling together, moving forward in a ‘national project’. There’s much to rebuild in France: that’s the message.”Bruno Tertrais of the Foundation for Strategic Research in  said the disaster might allow Macron a “Mitterandian moment” to “make his mark on Paris”, but was unlikely to have a profound impact on the politics of the presidency.“Yes, there has been an outpouring of unity and emotion,” Tertrais said. “But we all know such moments of national unity are short-lived – and I don’t think Macron is under any illusion this will last particularly long.”Tertrais said that if Macron could pull off the challenge of rebuilding Notre Dame within five years “that would perhaps transform a crisis into some form of opportunity. But politically, the postponement of the speech doesn’t really matter”.The pulled speech was to mark the conclusion of  an unprecedented three-month national consultation involving more than two million online contributions and some 10,000 hours of town hall debates around the country.Beginning last November as a mainly rural protest  and falling purchasing power, the   against Macron and the French establishment, triggering riots in Paris and other big cities with a violence not seen since the May 1968 student uprising.Presenting the findings of the debate last week, the prime minister, Édouard Philippe, said the principal theme to emerge from the debate was “huge exasperation” over tax. “We need to lower taxes and lower them faster,” he said.Other demands to emerge from the process included restoring the connections between urban and provincial France, introducing more grassroots democracy, and tackling climate change without penalising the poor.The question of how the government would lower taxes while also meeting French demands for better public services closer to home was to be left to Macron – whose eagerly awaited proposals were due on Monday.French media have said a string of measures are planned, including reducing the number of MPs; introducing more proportional representation and local referendums; guaranteeing no further school or hospital closures; and cutting income tax.Perhaps most symbolically, Macron is also said to be considering scrapping the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA), France’s renowned elite finishing school for senior civil servants, prime ministers and presidents.But in the wake of the Notre Dame disaster, a shopping list of reforms may no longer be enough, Heisbourg said.“The speech will have to be different from what he had planned,” he said. “The country needs, badly, a sense of direction. The public will be receptive to that, I think. But if they do not get it … this could prove to be a very important moment indeed.”"},

Her Red Cross colleagues and family also spoke.But the publicity was not welcomed by the government. At her weekly press conference, Ardern repeatedly refused to comment on the missing New Zealander and said the government remained of the opinion that the nurse’s name and situation should not have been made public.“Our view was that it should remain out of the public … we’ve taken a different view, we’ve disagreed with them [ICRC],” Ardern later told RNZ“Our position didn’t change, we did know the International Red Cross had a different view, we were aware of their plan, it just didn’t mean that we agreed with them.“It won’t change our relationship [with the ICRC], it just happens to be that we’ve taken different perspectives at this point.”The foreign minister, Winston Peters, said efforts to locate Akavi were “ongoing” and the government would not comment on operational and intelligence matters, although he did reveal that members of the New Zealand SAS had at one point been deployed to  as part of a multi-agency effort to rescue her.“We advised the ICRC at the highest level that NZ’s preference was not to publish,” he said in a statement.“The New Zealand view then, and continues to be, that the release of her story now increased the risks to her life. If there was any acknowledgement of their media plan, it was not an endorsement of their approach.”ICRC director of operations Dominik Stillhart said he was “surprised” that the New Zealand government had criticised the ICRC decision, as he believed it had the government’s support. He said a government representative was in his office on Friday and they were “fully aligned” on the next move.“I think it’s important to understand that every decision since 13 October 2013 was to maximise the chance of Louisa’s freedom, and every decision was co-ordinated with the New Zealand government … and that included the difficult decision to go public,” said Stillhart.“I am confident the decision was made in full transparency and co-ordination with the New Zealand government”“We would not have made that decision without the support of the New Zealand Government.”The decision to publish Akavi’s story also drew criticism from some New Zealand media outlets.TV3’s national correspondent Patrick Gower called the Red Cross decision to go public  and said the spat between the government and the aid agency was “a disgrace”.The last confirmed sighting of Akavi was in late 2018 near the Euphrates river at the Syrian-Iraqi border."},

I cannot face the suffering of these people.” Sousa added that the victims included 17 women and 11 men.The coach was reportedly carrying 55 passengers when it veered off a road on a bend east of the capital, Funchal, before rolling down a steep hillside, Sousa said. The Portuguese guide and driver reportedly survived the accident, and they along with the other wounded people were taken to hospital in Funchal.A spokeswoman for the hospital told German newspaper Bild: “We currently have our hands full. We have many injured people from the bus accident here. The ambulances drove them from Santa Cruz to us. Many are very badly injured.”Portuguese prime minister Antonio Costa said in a tweet that he had sent his condolences to the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. “I learned of this tragic accident in Madeira with deep sorrow,” he said.Merkel’s spokesman Steffen Seibert said “terrible news is reaching us from Madeira” and that “we are in deepest sorrow over all those who lost their lives in the bus crash.” He added: “Our thoughts are with the injured.”Germany’s foreign ministry said its embassy in Portugal’s capital, Lisbon, was in contact with local authorities in Madeira. Seibert said the government has set up a telephone hotline for people worried about family members.It was not clear whether the fatalities were confined to the bus passengers, and authorities are investigating the possible cause. Locals reported that the weather was fine at the time of the accident, which happened in daylight.A UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: “We are seeking information from the authorities in Portugal about a bus crash in Madeira, and are ready to support any British people who require assistance.”The Portuguese president Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa had intended to travel to Madeira on Wednesday evening following the crash, but it was reported that the aircraft he uses could be required to bring injured people to the mainland and therefore he has cancelled the trip. “This is a moment of pain, but also of solidarity,” Sousa told SIC. Five Italian tourists died in São Vicente, on the northern coast of Madeira, in a fatal bus crash in 2005."},

It tells the story of a group of Red Army soldiers whose departure from Afghanistan is delayed after they are ordered to free a Soviet general’s son taken captive by mujahideen fighters. Lungin told Variety magazine last year that the film depicts the “senselessness and cruelty of war”.After an advance screening, Igor Morozov, the deputy head of the upper house of parliament’s committee for science, education and culture, said it was unsuitable for “educating young people with a sense of patriotism” because it portrayed Red Army officers looting and fighting among themselves.

Now scientists say they might be able to pinpoint the culprits for individual tumours.Experts say they have managed to link particular environmental triggers with specific genetic mutations that give rise to cancer, opening up the possibility that researchers could look for clues in a tumour to deduce what triggered its formation.“Mutational signatures are the fingerprints that carcinogens leave behind on our DNA and, just like fingerprints, each one is unique,” said Dr Serena Nik-Zainal, of the Medical Research Council cancer unit at Cambridge University, who co-led the research. “They allow us to treat tumours as a crime scene and, like forensic scientists, allow us to identify the culprit, and their accomplices, responsible for the tumour.”Cancers develop as a result of changes to the DNA within cells. These changes – or mutations – can affect the way the cells divide and the growth of tissue, producing tumours. According to the , one in two people will develop cancer in their lifetime., researchers from the UK report how they exposed human stem cells, produced from skin cells, to 79 different chemicals or processes that are believed to cause cancer including solar radiation, various chemotherapy drugs and a host of substances found in tobacco smoke.Overall, the team found 41 of these – or 52% of the agents – produced distinct genetic changes that could be spotted in cells, with some producing more than one hallmark. The team then compared these signatures with mutations seen in human cancers.“We’ve used this technique to create the most comprehensive catalogue to date of the patterns of DNA damage produced by environmental agents across the whole human genome,” said Prof David Phillips of King’s College London. “It should allow us to examine a patient’s tumour and identify some of the carcinogens they have been exposed to that may have caused the cancer.”The team found that the artificial sun produced a similar set of mutations to those seen in UV-associated cancers, while genetic signatures were also seen for a range of substances found in tobacco smoke, with these similar to those seen in lung cancers associated with smoking. They also found genetic changes produced by the chemotherapy drugs cisplatin and carboplatin were consistent with those seen in myeloid tumors that developed in people who had undergone chemotherapy.Nik-Zainal said: “Our reference library will allow doctors in future to identify those culprits responsible for causing cancer. Such information could be invaluable in helping inform measures to reduce people’s exposure to potentially dangerous carcinogens.”While the team said the approach could also flag previously unknown causes of cancer, they urged caution, noting it could also lead to the suggestion of exposure to a substance which has not actually been encountered. “This is important to stress as it may have important legal implications for industries where some of these agents may be occupational exposures,” they wrote."},

{"title": "General Garibaldi in London – archive, 1864", "time": "Tue 16 Apr 2019 ", "category": "World", "tags": "Italy,From the Guardian archive,London", "content": "On Thursday evening, the General dined with the Duke and Duchess of Sutherland, and a select family party, including the Earl of Carlisle (who had just come over from Dublin), and at eight o’clock, accompanied by the Duke of Sutherland, proceeded to the Royal Italian Opera House, to witness the performance of the operas of Norma and Massaniello.Garibaldi’s intention to visit Covent Garden had become pretty well known, and a large number of persons assembled to witness his departure. The large space in front of Stafford House was inconveniently crowded long before eight o’clock; in fact, many persons had taken up their positions as early as six o’clock. At five minutes past eight o’clock a closed carriage belonging to the Duke of Sutherland drove up to the mansion, and almost immediately afterward, Garibaldi came out and took his seat. His appearance was the signal for loud and continuous cheering.As the carriage drove away crowds gathered round it, and, in spite of the pace at which it rolled along Pall Mall, a couple of dozen or more managed to hang on, in spite of the danger which they ran of being knocked down and run over by some rapidly-passing vehicle. The crowd along the streets took up the cry of “Garibaldi!” and followed with the others about the carriage, and soon there was quite an army following the General through the crowded thoroughfares of the West-end.In the neighbourhood of Covent Garden thousands of persons had assembled, and from soon after seven o’clock carriages had been setting down at the entrance to the Floral Hall, which was thrown open, and brilliantly lighted up on this occasion. Down each side of the street a closely-packed crowd had assembled, believing that the General’s carriage would take up its turn at the end, and come quietly down to the entrance hall. In this, however, they were disappointed, and a scene of some confusion ensued in consequence of the arrangements being broken.When the General’s carriage arrived the driver broke through the line, and at once proceeded to the Floral Hall entrance. This example was speedily followed by the crowd, who, in an instant, broke their ranks and surrounded the carriage. The shouts which were raised were perfectly deafening. The carriage was completely hemmed in – jammed as if in a vice. The Duke of Sutherland, apparently with a view to appease the crowd, let down the windows, when immediately hundreds of hands were held up in the air, and vain attempts were made by many to get near enough to get a shake from the General’s hand. Not a few succeeded in getting both their arms into the carriage.A large number of policemen drove back the crowd as best they could; but again the cry arose, “Garibaldi for ever!” and thus incited the ranks were again broken, the carriage again surrounded, the hands again pushed through the window – and in every respect there was a repetition of the scene which was anywhere to be seen between Westminster Bridge and Charing Cross on Monday last.At length the carriage got near the pavement; and, amidst the loud huzzas of the people, Garibaldi stepped into the grand entrance of the Floral Hall. He was received by Mr Gye, and conducted by him towards the centre of the hall; but the visitors immediately closed round him, and sought to shake hands, in accordance with the custom now apparently established wherever the General appears. For a few minutes this was submitted to, but it was soon found that if the distinguished visitor were to be permitted to gain his seat within a reasonable time, some method must be adopted to clear a passage for him. One or two inspectors of police and Superintendent Walker then interposed, and endeavoured to motion the crowd on one side; but their signs and entreaties were unheeded; and, as the space to be traversed became less and less, the crowd around the General became more and more dense, and it was necessary at last to use no inconsiderable degree of violence to force a passage for him.Respect for truth renders it necessary to say that the female portion of those present were even more eager than their male companions to reach Garibaldi, and, if they could not shake hands with him, at least to touch the grey cloak he wore. With his customary good nature, he submitted most quietly to the persecution, and at last when by the aid of his friends he gained the top of the staircase leading to the boxes, he raised his cap several times and saluted the people below before disappearing from their sight.During all the commotion which prevailed several persons audibly expressed the indignation they felt, and endeavoured to form a line, but without avail. The Duke of Sutherland and Mr Negretti, who were evidently much excited, remained on the staircase for some time with Garibaldi’s sons, and plainly expressed their annoyance. “It was clear,” says the Morning Post, “that the persons who had conducted themselves so indecorously were not the visitors to the house, as they remained in the hall for some time longer, but finally left when the act of turning off the gas admonished them that their presence was no longer desired.”"},
{"title": "Notre Dame fire: Macron pledges to rebuild devastated Paris cathedral", "time": "Tue 16 Apr 2019 ", "category": "Europe", "tags": "Notre Dame,Paris,France,Europe,news", "content": "A fire that devastated  Cathedral in the heart of Paris was brought under control by firefighters in the early hours of Tuesday morning, though officials warned there were still residual fires to put out.Thousands of Parisians watched in horror from behind police cordons as a ferocious blaze devastated Notre Dame Cathedral on Monday night, destroying its spire and a large part of the roof.An investigation has been opened by the prosecutor’s office, but police said it began accidentally and may be linked to building work at the cathedral. The 850-year-old gothic masterpiece had been undergoing restoration work.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, attended the scene and later gave a speech in which he vowed that the cathedral would be rebuilt, as fire crews said the landmark’s rectangular bell towers and structure of the building had been saved.Macron said “the worst had been avoided” thanks to hundreds of brave firefighters who battled for hours and who would continue working through the night. One firefighter was severely injured but no other casualties were reported.“What happened tonight in , in this cathedral, is a terrible event,” the president said, vowing to raise funds worldwide and bring the best talents from around the world to reconstruct the building in its entirety.“Notre Dame is our history, our literature, part of our psyche, the place of all our great events, our epidemics, our wars, our liberations, the epicentre of our lives ... So I solemnly say tonight: we will rebuild it together.”Macron announced an international fundraising campaign to raise money for the repairs. French billionaire François-Henri Pinault, the chairman and CEO of international luxury group Kering, pledged 100 million euros towards rebuilding Notre Dame.Laurent Nunez, junior minister of the interior said on Tuesday: “Now the fire danger has been dealt with, there is the issue of the building and whether the structure has resisted the very serious fire. A meeting of experts and national architects is taking place this morning to consider whether the building is stable and whether fire-officers can set up inside to continue their work.”Franck Riester, the culture minister, said the situation was still precarious but he was hopeful. “We’re optimistic because the two belfries were saved.”He said it was too early to determine exactly which pieces of priceless art were damaged, saying the organ had been affected and paintings may have suffered from water damage.Thousands of Parisians – many weeping and some praying – watched as vast orange flames soared from the roof for hours, threatening one of the greatest architectural treasures of the western world. There were gasps on the southern bank of the river Seine as locals watched fire sweep across the roof, which slowly caved in.The 12th-century cathedral is home to priceless works of art and is one of the world’s most famous tourist attractions, immortalised in Victor Hugo’s 1831 novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame. It attracts about 13 million visitors a year from around the world.“We consider the two towers of Notre Dame to have been saved,” the Paris fire-service commander Jean-Claude Galler said at around 11pm, as firefighters were still working to contain flames. The fire service said the fire had been reduced and it was a major accomplishment by hundreds of firefighters that the flames were stopped from spreading to the north tower belfry. However, the roof “had been ravaged”, with around two thirds destroyed.Fire brigade officers, who were preparing to spend the night attempting to cool the building, said the structure of the cathedral was “saved and preserved”. A spokesman said there was still a risk that scaffolding in the heart of the building could collapse.By 7pm, flames had burst through the roof of the cathedral and quickly engulfed the lead and wood structure of the cathedral’s spire, which collapsed.The spire had been added to the building in the 19th century. As part of its renovations, several bronze statues that surrounded the spire had been removed.The wooden frame at the top of the 13th-century landmark was made from so many oak beams that it was known as “the forest”. That wood proved so combustible, the Paris fire service said, that it there was a danger to firefighters.Smoke billowed into the sky, visible from across the city, and ash fell in the surrounding area.The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, said that most artworks and religious relics were removed from Notre Dame as firefighters worked to control the blaze.France’s culture minister, Franck Riester, posted photos on social media of people loading art on to trucks.Les agents du , épaulés par les équipes de l’archevêché, les  et les forces de sécurité, évacuent les œuvres se trouvant à l’intérieur de la cathédrale. Elles sont progressivement mises en sécurité.  The cathedral and surrounding buildings were evacuated and police closed several metro stations and cordoned off roads by the river.On the left bank of the river Seine, thousands of onlookers gathered at police cordons watching as the flames burned high into the clear blue sky. As part of the roof gradually collapsed in flames, bangs and crackles could be heard from the street. Some people sang Catholic liturgies as they watched. Others sank to their knees. Many were in tears.Camille, 20, from Normandy, a history student at the Sorbonne, watched as flames blazed through the frame of one of the cathedral’s smaller stained glass windows. “There’s a feeling of total sadness and also anger,” she said. “It’s our heritage. Whether you’re Christian or not, part of our history is going up in smoke.”Alexis, 35, a finance worker, had hurried to the scene after seeing the first images on the television news. “I rushed down. I never thought it would be this depressing,” he said. Over the course of an hour, he watched as the flames spread across the roof and sections of it slowly collapsed.A 55-year-old furniture restorer, who did not wish to give his name, said: “This is a major moment,” he said. “This building is a symbol of Catholicism. It’s a symbol of Paris.”On the north side of the cathedral on the Île Saint-Louis, more crowds had gathered. “It’s a national tragedy,” said Paul Rechter, who lives barely 100 metres from the cathedral. “It’s a symbol of  that is collapsing there, part of our national identity going up in smoke. Part of our history, our culture, our literature ... How on earth could it have happened? Why were there no precautions?”His wife Agnes said her parents and grandparents had lived on the Île Saint Louis and the Île de la Cité. “We have known the cathedral since childhood,” she said. “It’s part of our personal history, too.” She said she thought most of all of “the centuries of work, of craftsmanship, that went into that building ... The number of men who have worked on it down the years.”Pierre Mesnage, 44, who has lived on the Île de la Cité for the past 20 years in an apartment that overlooks the cathedral, said: “I cried when I saw it, honestly. I wept. I see that building every single day, all day if I’m at home. It’s a drama. A personal and a national tragedy. I’m a Catholic, too, so there’s an added significance. I really don’t understand how it could happen. This is an emblem of Paris, an emblem of France. Why wasn’t it protected?”Ruud van der Leij, a computer studies teacher from Rotterdam, said he had been staring at the flames for more than two hours. “You can’t look away,” he said. “It’s awful and fascinating at the same time. A terrible, awful, sad affair. Such a symbol.”Marina Valleix, 42, said she had come specially from her home in the 19th arrondissement of Paris. “I do treasure hunts with clues, for children, round the big Paris monuments,” she said. “I’m here more or less every weekend. I had to come and see.”The disaster “has got to me, definitely”, she said. “I’m confident it will be rebuilt, and I know Notre Dame has already burned, the spire has already fallen in the past. I know we can and will rebuild. But still, it’s sad. To see it like this, it’s terribly sad.”"},

We’re trying our best to keep shortages to a minimum and are expecting supply to improve in the coming few months.”Michael Brooks, executive director of the Poultry Industry Association of New Zealand, said supermarkets were struggling to get the volumes of eggs they required as the nation’s hen flock had decreased from 4.2m birds in 2018 to around 3.6m this year.The decrease comes as farmers search for new land and infrastructure to build much larger free-range farming operations.Some farmers were experiencing high levels of stress and anxiety at the rapid pace of the change, with others quitting the industry for good, Brooks said.“If you are looking at moving to free-range or even barn, you are basically looking at an entirely new farm, there’s a huge amount of pressures on farmers right now.”“Supermarkets are maybe struggling to get the volumes they’d like”.Brooks said farming free-range was more complex for farmers as they had to deal with issues such as weather, contamination of feed supply, diseases and a higher mortality rate among birds – which all contributed to a minimum 50% higher egg cost for consumers.A dozen free-range eggs cost NZ$7 and up at most supermarkets, while 30 caged eggs sell for NZ$9.5.Antoinette Laird, head of external relations for Foodstuffs New Zealand, said in a statement that while they weren’t facing any imminent shortages “there is a definite increase in demand for cage-free eggs as customers become increasingly concerned about animal welfare.”According to Consumer New Zealand at least three quarters of New Zealanders buy cage-free “at least some of the time”, while more than a quarter purchase free-range exclusively.Companies selling free-range eggs have doubled since 2010, but there are concerns there is still no standard definition of what free-range means.In 2017 found millions of free-range eggs sold at Countdown supermarket actually came from caged hens.In the European Union battery cages began to be phased out in 2012, while Switzerland was the first country in the world to ban them outright in 1992."},

The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, said many artworks and religious relics were removed in time – they included the , a purported relic of Christ’s crufixion, and the Tunic of St Louis, said to have been worn by the crusader French king.Prosecutors said they believed the fire started accidentally and their preliminary investigation had ruled out arson and terrorism. World leaders expressed sorrow and solidarity – the German chancellor Angela Merkel’s office tweeted: “Fluctuat nec mergitur”, Latin for “she is tossed by the waves but does not sink” – , when Notre Dame was completed.Around one in five teachers (18%) , blaming excessive workload and accountability pressures, according to a poll by the National Education Union. Overall, two-fifths of teachers, school leaders and support staff say they want to quit in the next five years. “My job is no longer about children,” one respondent said. “It’s just a 60-hour week with pressure to push children’s achievement data through.” Said another: My personal life doesn’t exist any more.” The government has announced plans to ease workload and help more teachers to job share – but the NEU is calling for drastic action to stop staff fleeing a “culture of fear, over-regulation, and a lack of trust”. One teacher’s verdict on what is needed: “Trust being given back to the teachers. Less paper pushing and more focus on the children. Less emphasis on SATs results.”Theresa May is under pressure to abandon cross-party Brexit talks. Labour appears to have little incentive to do a deal before the , that promise to be costly for the Conservatives. Tory officials are privately acknowledging the party will lose around half of its MEPs, with Ukip set for gains. Ministers and their Labour shadows are holding working groups this week seeking a Brexit compromise but no discussions about a customs union or second referendum are planned before Easter. The government’s alternative plan is for MPs to thrash out an acceptable version of May’s deal in the House of Commons, but experts have expressed doubt there is time to do this in the five weeks before the European elections. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, has conceded that having to fight the elections would be disastrous for the Tories.There is more heat on Donald Trump to release his tax records after two Democratic presidential hopefuls published a decade of their own.

And according to the CIA document dated 7 April 1978, European spies were keen to find out how it worked.“Representatives of West German, French and British intelligence services had visited the Condor organization secretariat in Buenos Aires during the month of September 1977 in order to discuss methods for establishment of an anti-subversion organization similar to Condor,” states the document.“The terrorist/subversive threat had reached such dangerous levels in  that they believed it best if they pooled their intelligence resources in a cooperative organization such as Condor,” the Europeans told the Condor secretariat in Buenos Aires, according to the CIA document.“They emphasized, however, that if such an organization were established (in Europe), all their operations against subversives would be closely coordinated so that the service of one country would not operate unilaterally in another country.”The document forms part of an astounding  relating to Argentina’s bloody 1976-83 dictatorship which were released on Friday. Consisting mostly of CIA and FBI files, the previously unseen documents throw a sharp light on the dark operations of Argentina’s seven-year military regime and the gruesome methods it employed to annihilate thousands of mostly young people.“These documents are very important,” said Gastón Chillier, of the Cels human rights group. “There are documents from six or seven different US intelligence agencies. We’re hopeful there may be information there that could help in the continuing trials against human rights offenders from the period.”A total of 977 former military officers and collaborators are currently in jail for crimes relating to Argentina’s dictatorship, according to the human rights prosecution office in Buenos Aires.Such crimes are described in gruesome detail in the files. One document spells out the first crude attempts by Argentina’s military to dispose of its victims after bodies washed up on the shores of neighbouring Uruguay in the second month of the dictatorship.“The government of Uruguay has been informed privately by Argentine authorities that eight of the 10 bodies found along the Uruguayan coast are the result of Argentine anti-terrorists operations,” a state department cable from May 1976 states. “The source said the bodies were jettisoned over the (River Plate) from Argentine helicopters after interrogations by Argentine authorities.”Argentina’s dictatorship later perfected its disposal method, drugging victims before slitting their stomachs open and .In another document, Robert Scherrer, the FBI legal attache in Buenos Aires who had extensive contacts with the Argentine military, reported to Washington in October 1976 how the bodies of two Cuban security officers were disposed of.Jesús Cejas Árias and Crescencia Galanena Hernández were kidnapped and murdered by the dictatorship in August 1976.“Their bodies were cemented into one large storage drum and thrown into the Rio Lujan river,” Scherrer reported. “Because Cejas and Galanena had been immersed in water for such a considerable period of time facilitating rapid decomposition, it is doubtful that they will be identified.” One heavily redacted CIA document from December 1976 describes how many so-called “confrontations” with leftwing guerrillas were in reality “fabrications on the part of the authorities designed to explain away the killing of prisoners who had been under detention”.Another state department cable in the cache dates from July 1978, a month after Argentina hosted and won the Fifa World Cup. The document says that Vatican diplomats informed the US embassy how “in mid-June (right in the middle of the World Cup games) a female psychologist was abducted by security forces and held for 15 hours”. During her detention, the psychologist, a polio victim who used a wheelchair, was tortured and interrogated with an electric “” (an electric cattle prod) regarding the whereabouts and activities of one of her patients.The release of the documents fulfils a formal request made by Argentina in 2016, on the 40th anniversary of the military coup, .This third release marks the end of Declassification Project for Argentina, following the release of two tranches of the documents during Obama’s administration."},

The Île-de-France region of which  is a part pledged a further €10m.Macron has said a national appeal, likely to be accompanied by tax incentives, would be launched as soon as possible, and the privately run French Heritage Foundation said its call for donations had raised €2m from individuals by midday on Tuesday.A range of fundraising events have already been announced, including benefit matches featuring France’s World Cup football champions and a star-studded concert to be broadcast on Saturday night on French public television.Unesco has said it will help France assess and repair the damage to the cathedral, which typically welcomes 13 million visitors a year, while Italy, Russia and Germany all offered to send restoration experts.Eric Fischer, who heads a foundation restoring the 1,000-year-old Strasbourg Cathedral that recently underwent a three-year facelift, said he thought rebuilding Notre Dame would probably take several decades.“The damage will be significant,” Fischer told Agence-France Presse. France was “lucky to still have a network of excellent heritage restoration companies”, he said, and the work would depend on the the plans, diagrams and other data available to them.Some have  that detailed 3D maps of Notre Dame created in recent years by academics such the late US art historian Andrew Tallon, who used laser scanners to create a model of the building accurate to within 5mm, could help – as could similar near-perfect computer models generated for video games such as , which is set in Paris.But Patrick Palem, a former chief executive of Socra, a restoration company, estimated the total length of the project at between 15 and 20 years, while Stéphane Bern, a TV presenter and the government’s heritage representative, put it at 10 to 20 years. “It will be rebuilt for future generations,” Bern said.Much would depend on the choices made by the architects, other experts said. François Janneau, one of 40 state architects responsible for France’s major monuments, said Nantes Cathedral, devastated by fire in 1972, was partly reopened three years later, though its timber roof beams were replaced with concrete.Amid calls for the “forest” of wooden beams that made up the gutted roof frame of Notre Dame’s nave to be replaced like for like, Sylvain Charlois, of the Charlois group, France’s biggest producer of oak, said he was worried about available stocks.About 1,300 oak trees were used to construct Notre Dame’s roof, Charlois said. “To constitute a big enough stock of oak logs of that quality will take several years.” He called on France’s timber merchants to make donations in kind.Jack Lang, who was culture minister under François Mitterrand, said talk of a decade or more of rebuilding was “a joke. We have to do the same thing as Strasbourg here, not in 10-15 years but three years. You have to set a short deadline.” "},

Fournier previously spent seven years with the French armed forces, including a tour in Afghanistan.

France’s culture minister, Franck Riester, tweeted photos of the operation.“Agents of the culture ministry, aided by the archbishop’s staff, the Paris fire brigade and the security services, are evacuating the works inside the cathedral,” Riester said. “They are being progressively brought to safety.”Les agents du , épaulés par les équipes de l’archevêché, les  et les forces de sécurité, évacuent les œuvres se trouvant à l’intérieur de la cathédrale. Elles sont progressivement mises en sécurité.  Gold, silver and gem-inlaid chalices, candelabras and many other artefacts survived the blaze and a significant proportion of the cathedral’s masterpieces and sacred relics were saved, authorities have confirmed, although not all.One of Notre Dame’s most treasured relics, the crown purports to be a band of rushes from the original crown of thorns placed on Jesus’s head during his crucifixion. Originally from Jerusalem, in 1238 it was given to King Louis IX, who built the Sainte-Chappelle in Paris especially to house it. It was later transferred to Notre Dame.Individual thorns have been distributed as relics around the world: the Notre Dame relic is the original circlet of rushes, encased in rock crystal. On Monday night the mayor of Paris .Notre Dame’s principal organist, Vincent Dubois, has said Notre Dame’s 8,000-pipe grand organ was not burned in the fire, although its condition – and whether it can still be played – is not yet clear. Originally built in 1403, the organ has been updated and renovated in the centuries since, most recently in 2013, but some of the current organ’s pipes .Bertrand de Feydeau, a senior French heritage preservation official, said: “The organ is a very fragile instrument, especially its pipes. It has not burnt, but no one can tell whether it has been damaged by water. Nobody knows if it is a functioning state or will need to be restored.”The tunic of Saint Louis is a 13th-century linen garment said to have belonged to King Louis, the only French king to become a saint. Crowned in 1226, Louis participated in the Seventh Crusade and died during the Eighth Crusade in 1270. He was canonised in 1297. The Paris mayor, Anne Hidalgo, said the tunic was saved from the fire.Along with the Crown of Thorns, Notre Dame housed a purported fragment of the True Cross, upon which Jesus is said to have been crucified, and an original nail that was used. These too were saved from the flames, French media reported.All three of Notre Dame’s immense stained glass windows appear to have survived, although experts have yet to inspect them and they may have sustained hidden damage.One of the cathedral’s centrepieces, the sculpture by Nicolas Coustou lies on Notre Dame’s high altar. Initial photos suggest that the sculpture was mostly unharmed.A large number of artworks and sculptures were taken from the cathedral and carried across the River Seine to Paris town hall, Riester said. It is not yet clear which of the following major works are among them:This statue, known as , with which the cathedral shares its name, depicts the Virgin Mary and Jesus. Created in the 14th century, it was moved to Notre Dame in 1818.Another 18-century sculpture by Nicolas Coustou. Saint Denis is the patron saint of Paris, and a depiction of him preaching stood in the cathedral.Made in the 17th century and , this painting depicts the saint and people drinking from a fountain of wisdom.“We have avoided a complete disaster. But some five to 10 percent of the artwork has probably been destroyed, we have to face up to that,” said Maxime Cumunel, secretary general of France’s Observatory for Religious Heritage.Four of the largest-scale 17th and 18th century paintings depicting scenes from the lives of the apostles had been damaged, at least in part, he said.Three relics that were not in the cathedral’s treasury are also known to have been lost: a separate fragment of the Holy Crown of Thorns, a relic of Saint Denis and a relic of Saint Geneviève."},

He was tried behind closed doors.Prosecutors said Berg was caught with naval documents provided to him by a former Russian police officer, Aleksey Zhitnyuk, who was sentenced to 13 years on treason charges in December.Berg denied the espionage charges but admitted working as a courier for Norwegian intelligence. He said he did not know he was receiving classified documents.His lawyer, Ilya Novikov, said his client would not appeal against the verdict and would request a pardon from Russia’s president, .“He’s been used without his knowledge,” Novikov told the AFP news agency. “He expects his government to undertake diplomatic efforts.

The huge wooden doors were open as firefighters continued to secure the building, hinting at the dangers and weaknesses that may still lie within.Inside, beneath a gaping hole above the choir area where the burning spire  on , lay rubble, shards of glass, and twisted metal, but the altar and gleaming cross were still standing. “It felt like I was looking at a bombing,” said Philippe Marsset, the vicar general of Notre Dame, one of the first to enter to survey the damage.The cathedral square, usually heaving with tourists brandishing selfie sticks, was cordoned off, eerily silent and deserted, its paving stones peppered with flecks of black ash.On the edge of the River Seine, where the gothic architectural masterpiece sits proudly on an island, locals were still coming to terms with the fear and panic of the night before, when fire had raged across the roof, believed to have been started accidentally possibly as a result of building work.From the moment the first flames became visible, hundreds had run down to the river shouting “Notre Dame is burning!” Then, for hours, stunned crowds looked on as flames soared into the sky and the spire and most of the roof gradually caved in.Crowds sang church liturgies, many wept, some fell to their knees in grief, and most gasped and wailed at each loud crackle as the spire was engulfed in flames. In a city that has endured years of terrorist killings, waking to bloodstains on the street, there was relief that no one had been killed. Some said they felt anger and a sense of shame. “Think of the all people who , and on our watch we let it burn,” said an older woman with a walking cane, wiping her eyes. was still in shock. “I came back this morning to check it wasn’t just a nightmare I’d wake up from,” said Paul Piron, a 23-year-old literature student. He had stood until midnight singing liturgies and Ave Marias as he watched the cathedral burn.“We were terrified it would collapse completely,” he said. He had attended vespers there every Sunday for three years. “It’s not just stone, it’s a place of life, a parish.” It was devastating to think it could be years before people could return. “I think it will be another 10 years before I can go inside again,” he said.For Parisians, Notre Dame had seemed imperishable. Crusaders prayed there before leaving for holy wars, it had outlived the monarchs and the pillaging of the French Revolution. It hosted Napoleon Bonaparte’s coronation, survived wars and Nazi occupation, ringing its bells to mark the liberation of Paris. And once again, here it was still standing. But the missing roof and spire left a sorrowful gap against the white sky. “There’s something empty, missing,” said Eric Zelnick, 69, who lived in nearby Le Marais and had walked past it every day for decades. “It was the face of Paris, now it’s a face missing its teeth.”In the French national psyche, Notre Dame was more than a historic house of God; it was a marker, a reference point, even in secular . The most-visited monument in the capital, attracting 12 million tourists a year, it is a symbol of literature and history, and is France’s “zero kilometre” point from which all road distances are measured.At more than 850 years old, its age had always served as a reminder that it could outlive all those who wandered past, in awe of its beauty.“There’s something very deep that comes up in all of this – we’re just a little tiny part of the story of this building,” said Jean Cottin, 55, a film producer who had returned to see the damage after watching the spire fall on Monday night. “I always came here as a child, it was a place of imagination. Now I’m wondering if I’ll ever see it rebuilt in my lifetime. It makes you think about the passing of time: our lives are a blink of an eye in the lifetime of this building which has stood for so long.”He said the charred structure had become a symbol of endurance. “It’s devastated yet it’s still standing – there’s a kind of strength that comes from that.”Firefighters moved along the tops of the bell towers, checking for damage. The cathedral had gone from a shocking vision of towering orange flames rising into the clear blue sky early on Monday evening, to a damaged structure against a white sky of drizzle in the morning.There was concern in the crowd: would we, in our modern era of technology, be up to rebuilding what skilled craftsmen and genius had defied all odds to create centuries ago?Bertrand de Feydeau, from the preservation group , said the wooden roof was built with beams from primal forests more than 800 years ago. “We don’t, at the moment, have trees on our territory of the size that were cut in the 13th century,” he said. So the roof may never be built exactly the same, it will always carry the mark of this era and will have to use modern technology.Catherine, 80, from Brittany, a former nurse who had worshiped at Notre Dame, cycled there to contemplate the damage. “I’m optimistic that there was talk of rebuilding it before the fire had even gone out,” she said.But she was aware of the long years ahead where it would have to be closed to the public. “I won’t be able to go back into it in my lifetime,” she sighed, as she parked her bike to stand and pray."},

Local news outlets said the defendants were accused of building a cell called “Bahraini ”, similar to the Lebanese armed group funded by , in order to sow discord in the Gulf kingdom.Some had trained in Iran, Lebanon and Iraq, “at the behest of Iranian regime leaders who ordered the Iranian Revolutionary Guard elements to unify the Bahrain-based terrorist elements to carry out their plots and acts of terrorism against Bahrain,” Hammadi said.Those tried were found guilty of training with and using illegal weapons and explosives, detonating bombs and attempted murder, and other sentences handed down ranged from between three and 10 years.All the detainees are believed to be members of the Sunni-ruled country’s Shia majority, which has long accused the kingdom of discriminating against them. Thirty defendants were acquitted, Hammadi said. Fifty-eight of the defendants were tried in absentia, a judicial source told Agence France-Presse.According to rights groups, Bahrain is increasingly using terrorism-related charges and the removal of citizenship to crack down on mostly peaceful political activists. Opposition members and rights activists , and authorities have denied multiple accusations of torture.Since new laws were introduced in 2012 after the previous year’s Arab Spring protests, 990 people have had their Bahraini citizenship revoked, 180 of them in 2019 alone, and mass trials have become commonplace.In February, 167 people who were arrested in 2017 at a sit-in outside the home of Bahrain’s leading Shia cleric were sentenced to between six months and 10 years in prison. Last May, 115 people were stripped of their citizenship after a single trial. Their sentences were upheld in January.Last September, 169 people were also charged with being members of Bahraini Hezbollah.Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, an advocacy director at the London-based Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy, said the ruling on Tuesday was the biggest single case of citizenship stripping since 2012.“Today’s trial is a dark stain on Bahrain’s history and marks a tragic moment in the ongoing crackdown on civil liberties in Bahrain,” he told the Guardian. “Most … of the men convicted seem to have had their citizenship revoked, rendering them stateless, and all appear to be from Bahrain’s Shia community. The unabated revocation of citizenship sets a very dangerous precedent for the future of Bahraini society.”Amnesty International condemned the court’s decision, calling it a “mockery of justice”. Lynn Maalouf, the organisation’s Middle East research director, said: “Arbitrarily stripping people of their citizenship and rendering citizens stateless are blatant violations of international law. Bahrain’s authorities must immediately stop relying on these unlawful measures as punishment.”It was not immediately clear whether the detainees stripped of Bahraini citizenship would be deported or where they could go. In 2018, eight Bahrainis whose citizenship had been revoked for “damaging state security” were sent to Iraq.Since the 2011 pro-democracy uprising, there have been sporadic outbreaks of violence including bomb attacks in Bahrain, a western-allied island state that is home to the US navy’s fifth fleet. The country accuses Iran of stoking Shia militancy inside its borders by providing training and weapons to various armed groups.Tehran supported the Arab Spring protests in the country but has repeatedly denied backing local militant groups that have carried out attacks on security forces."},

Another zooms in on a figure apparently wearing a hi-vis vest and hard hat, captioning it as a “Muslim at Notre Dame”.These have been accompanied by other claims, spread in comments on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, and on “independent” media sites, that attempt to suggest the fire was deliberately started. One said it was “suspicious” that “officials have stated there was no work being done and the cathedral was empty”; another tweet, since deleted, claimed to be from someone who knew an employee at the church, and said they had been told it was an act of arson.There were also tweets from accounts purporting to be news outlets such as CNN and Fox News, claiming that the fire was caused by “an act of terrorism”, and spreading false claims about the reaction of the US congresswoman Ilhan Omar.The  public prosecutor, Rémy Heitz, said on Tuesday that “nothing indicates” the Notre Dame blaze, which brought the building’s spire and roof crashing down, was started on purpose. The cathedral had been undergoing intensive restoration work, which firefighters said could be linked to the inferno, investigators said.As well as outright lies, misinformation was spread in other ways. A 2016 news story about an apparent plot to blow up the church has been widely spread over the past 24 hours, frequently without mentioning that the story is three years old.The Guardian’s  was linked to from the homepage of the influential rightwing news site Drudge Report, sending tens of thousands of readers to a three-year-old story. The Guardian’s version of the story contains a clear disclaimer that the news is “more than two years old”. Many publishers do not include such disclaimers, and some outlets even rewrote the story after the fire.While not crossing into misinformation, key figures on the far right have used the fire to further stoke anti-Muslim fears. In a tweet, , the parliamentary group leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany, the country’s largest opposition party, implied a connection between the fire and previous anti-Christian “attacks” in France.“During Holy Week Notre Dame burns. March: second largest church Saint-Sulpice burns. February: 47 attacks in ,” Weidel wrote.“The Observatory on Intolerance and Discrimination Against Christians in  speaks of a significant increase,” she added, including a link to a March article in a German Catholic magazine headlined “Catholic churches desecrated across France”."},
{"title": "Notre Dame assessed for structural damage after fire extinguished", "time": "Tue 16 Apr 2019 ", "category": "Europe", "tags": "Notre Dame,Paris,France,Europe,Emmanuel Macron,news", "content": "Police and fire services will spend the next 48 hours assessing the “security and safety” of  Cathedral after a fire at the historic monument in the centre of Paris on Monday evening.Laurent Nunez, a junior interior minister, said on Tuesday that the primary concern of French authorities was identifying weaknesses in the centuries-old structure.“We have identified some vulnerabilities in the structure … notably in the vault and the north transept pinion that needs securing,” Nunez said. He said this work would take 48 hours and residents of five buildings around the north transept were being evacuated.Architects have identified three main holes in the structure, in the locations of the spire, the transept and the vault of the north transept. The wooden roof beams have been burned, and parts of the stone vaulting holding up the roof have collapsed.As well as damage from the heat, which firefighters said reached more than 800C, experts also need to assess damage from the vast quantities of water that the firefighters poured into the cathedral.French interior minister, Christophe Castaner, said the cathedral was “under permanent surveillance because it can still budge.”The fire was discovered at 6.43pm local time at the base of the spire, which was constructed of wood and lead in the 19th century, and reached a height of 93 metres from the ground. The flames quickly spread to the cathedral’s ribbed roof, made up of hundreds of oak beams, some dating back to the 13th century, and known as “” (the forest).Nunez praised the actions of the  fire service, who he said had battled “not just outside but inside the building at great risk to their own lives”.The 500 firefighters at the scene had battled to prevent the flames reaching the two belfry towers, where the cathedral bells hang. If the wooden frame of the towers had caught fire it could have sent the bells – the largest of which, the Emmanuel bell, weighs 13 tonnes – crashing down, potentially causing the collapse of both gothic towers. “They saved the edifice but it all came down to 15-30 minutes,” Nunez said.Gabriel Plus, a spokesman for the Paris fire service, said: “We are satisfied and grateful that in risking their lives [firefighters] safeguarded the structure of the two belfries, the towers – and the works of art. Now I can confirm the fire is completely out.”The culture minister, Franck Riester, said religious relics saved from the cathedral, including the Crown of Thorns and Saint Louis’s tunic, were being securely held at the Hôtel de Ville, and works of art that sustained smoke damage were being taken to the Louvre where they would be dried out, restored and stored.He said three stained-glass “rose” windows did not appear to be damaged but would be examined more closely when the cathedral was made safe. Photos from inside the monument suggest Notre Dame’s grand organ, built in the 1730s and boasting 8,000 pipes, was spared from the flames.Sixteen copper statues that decorated the spire, representing the 12 apostles and four evangelists, had been removed for restoration only a few days before the fire. Relics at the top of the spire are believed lost as the spire was destroyed.As well as damage from the heat, which firefighters said reached more than 800C, experts also need to assess damage from the vast quantities of water that the firefighters poured into the cathedral.Police have begun questioning workers who were carrying out renovations at the cathedral. The Paris prosecutor’s office has opened an inquiry into “involuntary destruction by fire”, indicating they believe the  was accidental rather than criminal.Julien Le Bras, from the scaffolding company involved in the renovation, said his company had worked on a number of historic buildings in , including the Louvre, and none of his workers were at the site when the fire broke out.“It is with unqualified sadness I am speaking,” he told a press conference. “The police investigation is taking place and our workers will help answer questions with no reserve whatsoever to throw light on the cause of this drama. At the moment the fire started, none of the workers of my company was present at the site. All security and fire requirements were respected.”Monseigneur Michel Aupetit, the archbishop of Paris, said people around the world loved “this extraordinary cathedral”. “When we arrived yesterday evening we wanted to cry and people were crying around us,” he said. “Notre Dame is a symbol; more than a symbol, it is the soul of France.”He told BFMTV: “Notre Dame de Paris on the Île de la Cité , [in the] centre of Paris, is charged with history, with events through the centuries. It draws people, they come to look and they respect the place and they come to pray.”, the French president, who was at the scene on Monday evening, said a fundraising campaign would be launched immediately, as well as an appeal to international experts to help rebuild Notre Dame.Two of France’s richest tycoons pledged millions to the fund. It was announced that €100m had been pledged from the family fortune of François Pinault, the founder of Kering, which owns fashion labels including Alexander McQueen and Gucci. Shortly afterwards, Bernard Arnault, the chief executive of the LVMH group, announced a donation of €200m.French luxury and cosmetics group L’Oreal, along with the Bettencourt Meyers family and the Bettencourt Schueller foundation, also said they would donate €200m. The energy company Total is to give €100m.The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, called for a “donors’ conference”, not only to raise money for the reconstruction but to involve experts from around the world.The UN’s Paris-based cultural agency, Unesco, promised to stand “at France’s side” to restore the site, which it declared a world heritage site in 1991.“We are already in contact with experts and ready to dispatch an urgent mission to evaluate the damage, save what can be saved and start elaborating measures for the short and medium term,” Unesco’s secretary general, Audrey Azoulay, said on Tuesday."},

The campaign operating the website claimed to have gathered over 250,000 signatures against the reforms.Anwar Sadat, the nephew of the former president, head of the Reform and Development party and a member of the Civil Democratic Movement, said the amendments take  back to a time before the 2011 revolution.“Since the legislative authority and the state institutions do not grasp the dangers of violating the constitution and tailoring specific articles to fit only the president, the Reform and Development party calls all Egyptians to turn out and reject the amendments,” he said."},

The 16 stalls at the floating market are now dominated by vendors selling clogs, magnets, young cannabis plants, wooden and plastic tulips and bulbs.“I have had enough of all the tourists who ruin my trade,” Saarloos told the Dutch newspaper Trouw. “If they are here with a group, I can no longer serve my own customers.”Amsterdam has  with a tourist boom, with an estimated 18.5 million visitors flocking to the city this year, raising concerns about its so-called Disneyfication.By 2025, about 23 million visitors annually are expected.

So not just welding, not just brazing, it is also cutting, it is also grinding, it is also soldering and it is particularly lead work on roofs.”, pointed to the loss of  which occurred while contractors were putting a new roof on after the 1987 gales. “They applied too much heat and set fire to the timber under the lead which smouldered and then burst into flames.“I would be very surprised if the same hasn’t happened in , that this wasn’t the cause.”Many historic buildings have spaces between the ceiling and the roof, which appears to be the case at .“It is exactly what happened at Windsor Castle when the fire broke into St George’s Hall. That is such a common design feature in old buildings, a false ceiling … they are more vulnerable when they have it because firefighters can’t get to it and it will spread to the point where it destroys the structure.”He said the sad thing was that nobody appeared to learn from such cases.“If I see scaffolding being erected on a heritage building my heart sinks because I know it has got a strong probability of a fire.”Kidd said in the UK the only legislation was around the protection of people, not that of the building. “The government view is that property protection is a matter for the property owner and his or her insurer. They consistently refuse to get involved.”If there was any consolation to be taken from Notre Dame, he said, it was that it did not appear to have had any timber beams replaced with steel ones during 19th century refurbishments, something which happened a lot at the time. “I guarantee that if it had steel beams in, which has happened in some churches as part of Victorian refurbishment, it could have pushed out the walls.”Marc Bettinelli of Le Monde has been posting some images from  since the outbreak of the fire.

It demands authorities use “legal, political and diplomatic” measures to neutralise the American move, without elaborating.Donald Trump and the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, announced last week that the US had designated the guards as , marking the first time Washington has formally named a branch of the armed forces of a foreign government as a terrorist group.The US move aims at “thwarting Iran’s influence” and shows that America’s longstanding sanctions against  have become ineffective, Hatami told lawmakers.During the debate, some hardline lawmakers had demanded listing the entire US army and security forces as terrorist.The TV report said 204 lawmakers approved the bill, out of 207 present at the session in the 290-seat chamber. Two lawmakers voted against the bill and one abstained.However, it remains unclear how the bill’s passage in parliament would affect the Guard’s activities in the Persian Gulf, where the US navy has in the past accused Iranian patrol boats of harassing American warships.The Revolutionary Guard has forces and wields influence in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen, and is in charge of Iranian missiles that have US bases in their range.The Guard’s designation – the first-ever for an entire division of another government – adds another layer of sanctions to the powerful paramilitary force and makes it a crime under US jurisdiction to provide it with material support.Depending on how broadly “material support” is interpreted, the designation may complicate US diplomatic and military cooperation with certain third-country officials, notably in Iraq and Lebanon, who deal with the Guard.

Less than a century after building of the present  began in 1163, fire damage is thought to have prompted the remodelling of parts of the cathedral. The Gothic structure replaced an earlier church that had been built on the site of a Roman temple to Jupiter. By the 19th century the building was in a state of deep neglect: almost a ruin and lacking its spire.A complete restoration in the 1850s by the architects Jean-Baptiste Lassus and Eugène Viollet-le-Duc reversed the cathedral’s dire situation. Viollet-le-Duc also added a replacement spire in the style of, though more elaborate than, the original. By this stage, the medieval spires of the Amiens, Reims and Rouen cathedrals had already been destroyed – Rouen’s by fire caused by lightning in 1822.Notre Dame, before , was not a 12th-century time capsule, but consisted of layers of remaking and reworking – in the case of Viollet-le-Duc’s work, based on careful, loving research and a deep respect for the methods of the medieval builders. Which is not to minimise the tragedy and loss involved in the terrible damage to this numinous building, but rather, to suggest that there is hope: Notre Dame can, and surely will, live on.On 19 September 1914, Reims cathedral – another edifice of huge symbolic importance to the French nation, where generations of monarchs were crowned – was hit by German shells, setting wooden scaffolding on fire, melting lead in the roof and causing fire to consume wooden fixtures and pews. The cathedral sustained yet more damage through the first world war, but its ruins rose again after a huge post-war international effort, to which Rockefeller millions contributed. It reopened in 1938.“Nous rebâtirons Notre-Dame” (we will rebuild Notre Dame), promised the French president, Emmanuel Macron. Donors such as the billionaire luxury brand owner François Pinault have already pledged funds.But many questions lie ahead. What, precisely, will rebuilding mean? To what extent could, or should, the damaged parts be re-created precisely? In any case, what might “re-creation” consist of in a building that to a degree mingles the medieval and the 19th century, and serves a society so different to that of the 12th century? What modern building materials and methods should be introduced? How could a cathedral’s spiritual atmosphere be evoked afresh? Should the restoration retain traces and memory of the fire damage – for example, in the way the architect David Chipperfield, in his , preserved some of the scars that the building sustained during the second world war?The damage is seemingly not so complete as to require the radical solution offered in the case of St Paul’s Cathedral in London, when a medieval edifice was replaced with a bold new building in a fresh baroque style after the 1666 fire. But it is certainly possible that a rebuilt Notre Dame could, and perhaps should, contain architectural and artistic gestures that speak of our own time.There are lessons to be learned about buildings and shared cultural memory. The causes of the fire are unknown and will be until the proper investigations are completed. What is well understood, however, is that complex, multi-layered historic buildings that are undergoing building or restoration work – as was the case for Notre Dame – are at particular risk from fire.No city understands this better than Glasgow. The School of Art, Charles Rennie Mackintosh’s masterpiece, was  during the final stages of its rebuild, after a first fire ravaged the school in 2014. The causes of the blaze have not yet been – and may never be – precisely determined, though it was recently reported that investigators were considering the theory that linseed-oil soaked rags, used to treat the school’s wooden panelling, may have been to blame.The cost of neglect of buildings can be unspeakable: the Museu Nacional in Rio, for example, which was , had been starved of funds and was palpably incapable of protecting its collections, which represented the memory of a nation.Some observers, within hours of the Notre Dame tragedy, have turned their attention to the . Its restoration, which may cost more than £3.5bn to renovate and make safe, has been delayed through political inaction for years. Some may feel that if the Houses of Parliament, where fires break out regularly and is monitored 24 hours a day, were to burn there would be little to mourn. But people might feel rather differently if the worst were actually to happen. The sight of Parisians lining the Seine bridges to watch the flames on Monday night recalled similar scenes – the night of 16 October, 1834, when Londoners gathered to watch, aghast, the medieval Palace of Westminster burn down.Whatever happens to Notre Dame, the restoration has the capacity to be an act of archaeology and study as well as an act of remaking. Researchers would have the chance to learn much about the building that would in turn inform its future. It could be a training ground for a new generation of craftspeople and a cradle of art.  already shows signs, by sheer force of will, of transforming this moment of grief into a moment of optimism."},

However, demonstrators are pushing for a quick handover of power to civilians.Some of the most prominent protest leaders, most of whom are in their 20s and 30s and were only released from detention in recent days, have called for the dissolution of Bashir’s National Congress party, the seizure of its assets and the arrest of the party’s leading officials.They also want the dissolution of paramilitary groups loyal to the former government, major reforms of the security services and an end to repressive laws.“For us, in the first stage, the transitional government stage, we will play a role in … establishing a democratic state,” said Gamaria Omar, a member of the Sudanese Professionals Association, a grouping of teachers, engineers and doctors which led the protests.“Afterwards, the SPA will be … a guardian of democracy in .”Thousands of protesters remain camped outside the army headquarters in the capital, though numbers have declined since last week. The SPA has urged protesters to keep up the sit-in.The resignation of Salah Abdallah Mohamed Saleh, better known as Salah Gosh, on Saturday as the head of Niss emboldened the protest movement. Gosh was once seen as the most powerful person in the country after Bashir and protesters held him responsible for the killing of demonstrators demanding an end to military rule.Bashir was one of the longest-serving leaders in Africa and the Arab world.

The RSF has been repeatedly blamed for extensive human rights abuses.Other members of the 10-strong military council include a Niss representative and the chief of police.Analysts believe the army may be waiting for splits in the protest movement to appear. The opposition in Sudan is fragmented and current unity may prove transitory, they say.Officials say at least 65 people have died in protest-related violence since the unrest began."},
{"title": "Notre Dame was ‘15 to 30 minutes’ away from complete destruction", "time": "Tue 16 Apr 2019 ", "category": "Europe", "tags": "Notre Dame,Paris,France,Europe,Catholicism,Emmanuel Macron,Heritage,news", "content": " Cathedral was within “15 to 30 minutes” of complete destruction as firefighters battled to stop flames reaching its gothic bell towers, French authorities have revealed.A greater disaster was averted by members of the  fire brigade, who risked their lives to remain inside the burning monument to create a wall of water between the raging fire and two towers on the west facade.The revelation of how close France came to losing its most famous cathedral emerged as police investigators  in the restoration of the monument to try to establish the cause of the devastating blaze.Paris prosecutor Remy Heitz saidthat an initial fire alert was sounded at 6:20pm on Monday evening but no fire was found. The second alert was sounded at 6:43pm, and the blaze was discovered on the roof.More than €650m (£562m) was raised in a few hours on Tuesday as French tycoons and global corporations announced they would donate to the restoration campaign launched by the president, .But as the emergency services picked through the charred debris, a row was resurfacing over accusations that the Unesco-listed cathedral, immortalised in  The Hunchback of Notre Dame, was already crumbling before the fire.The cathedral is owned by the state and has been at the centre of a years-long dispute between the nation and the Paris archdiocese over who should finance restoration work to collapsed balustrades, crumbling gargoyles and cracked facades.Jean-Michel Leniaud, the president of the scientific council at the National  Institute, said: “What happened was bound to happen. The lack of real upkeep and daily attention to such a major building is the cause of this catastrophe.”After the conflagration was declared completely extinguished, 15 hours after it started, the junior interior minister, Laurent Nunez, said the structure had been saved but remained vulnerable. He praised the actions of the firefighters but admitted the fate of the cathedral had been uncertain. “They saved the edifice, but it all came down to 15-30 minutes,” Nunez said.In a surprise televised address on Tuesday evening, Macron said he wanted to see the cathedral rebuilt within five years.“The fire at Notre Dame reminds us that our history never stops and we will always have challenges to overcome,” Macron said. “We will rebuild Notre Dame, more beautiful than before – and I want it done in the next five years. We can do it. After the time of testing comes a time of reflection and then of action.”The fire, which had started at the base of the 93-metre spire at about 6.40pm on Monday, spread through the cathedral’s ribbed roof, made up of hundreds of oak beams, some dating back to the 13th century. These beams, known as  (the forest) because of their density, formed the cross-shaped roof that ran the length of the nave and transept above stone vaults.As hundreds of tourists and Parisians stood and  leaping from the roof, there was shock and tears as the cathedral spire caught fire, burned and then collapsed into itself.The 500 firefighters at the scene then battled to prevent the flames from reaching the two belfry towers, where the cathedral bells hang. If the wooden frame of the towers had caught fire, it could have sent the bells – the largest of which, the Emmanuel Bell, weighs 13 tonnes – crashing down, potentially causing the collapse of both gothic towers.Police and fire services will spend the next 48 hours assessing the “security and safety” of the 850-year-old structure.Nunez said: “We have identified some vulnerabilities … notably in the vault and the north transept pinion that needs securing.” Residents of five buildings around the north transept were being temporarily evacuated, he added.Architects have identified three main holes in the structure, in the locations of the spire, the transept and the vault of the north transept. Most of the wooden roof beams have been burned, and parts of the concrete vaulting holding up the roof have collapsed.The interior minister, Christophe Castaner, visited the cathedral on Tuesday afternoon to see the extent of the devastation. Ash covered the marble diamond-patterned floor and floated in large pools of grey water from the fire hoses. Behind a heap of blackened oak beams that lay piled up where they had fallen, daylight from vast holes in the cathedral roof lit a golden cross over the Pietà statue by Nicolas Coustou, which appeared untouched.The Great Organ constructed in the 1730s with about 8,000 pipes was said to have been damaged by water but escaped the flames; initial inspections suggested the three ornate stained glass “rose” windows also appeared to have survived the fire, officials said.Fire officers have said a complete inventory of the damage will not be possible until the cathedral structure has been deemed safe.The culture minister, Franck Riester, said religious relics saved from the cathedral, including the Crown of Thorns and Saint Louis’s tunic, were being securely held at the Hôtel de Ville, and works of art that sustained smoke damage were being  where they would be dried out, restored and stored.Sixteen copper statues that decorated the spire, representing the 12 apostles and four evangelists, had been removed for restoration only a few days before the fire. Relics at the top of the spire are believed lost as the spire was destroyed.As well as damage from the heat, which firefighters said reached more than 800C (1,470F), experts also need to assess damage from the vast quantities of water firefighters poured into the cathedral.French political commentators noted the devastating fire had succeeded where Macron had failed in uniting the country. Politics was put aside as the president cancelled a statement and press conference giving details of measures emerging from his “great debate” in response to  (yellow vests) protests.But recriminations over the state of the building and the restoration are likely to intensify over coming days. Leniaud told La Croix newspaper: “This is not about looking for people to blame. The responsibility is collective because this is the most loved monument in the country.”Alexandre Gady, an art historian, agreed. “We’ve been saying for years that the budget for [maintaining] historic monuments is too low,” Gady told FranceInfo.The Paris prosecutor’s office has opened an inquiry into “involuntary destruction by fire”, indicating they believe the  was accidental rather than criminal."},

Neither of the US companies would comment. Reuters reported that Google had complied with the order.The app was still available on Apple’s platforms late on Tuesday, but was no longer available on Google’s Play store in India.The app – which allows users to make and share short videos – can still be used by those who have already downloaded it on their smartphones.India’s supreme court, which on Monday rejected a Tiktok appeal to suspend the order, is to hear the case again on 22 April.“We have faith in the Indian judicial system and we are optimistic about an outcome that would be well received by over 120 million monthly active users in India,” Tiktok said in a statement Tuesday.The Chennai case was launched by an activist group which said the app encouraged paedophiles and pornography.With short videos of up to 15 seconds, Tiktok has become a major rival to Facebook, Instagram and other social network sites among teenage smartphone users in the past year.Tiktok has found particular popularity in smaller cities and towns among first-time internet users who don’t speak English, said Jayanth Kolla of technology consultancy Convergence Catalyst, a demographic underserved by the large U.S.-based social media giants.“It looks like the Chinese internet companies have cracked the code of getting into India,” Kolla said. “The speed and the rate at which some of these apps are growing, that is alarming. It definitely requires more time to study better.”But facing increased pressure the app, which is owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, said last week it had taken down six million videos in India since last July which had infringed its guidelines.The company said the measures were to “reinforce our ongoing commitment to ensure that our platform remains a safe and positive space for our Indian users.”Branches of the Indian government have signalled that they will start taking a tougher line on policing the internet. But this stricter approach has sparked concern about government overreach and censorship. Some say it could herald a shift towards a new internet model in India echoing to China’s own “Great Firewall.”“For Google to have complied with a directive is quite remarkable,” said Arun Mohan Sukumar, an internet governance specialist at think tank Observer Research Foundation. Sukumar said this could lead to increased pressure being put on companies like Google and Apple. “This is probably going to be seen as an opportunity by many law enforcement agencies to go for the jugular,”he said.Tiktok has continued to be drawn into controversy in India.On Sunday a 19-year-old man was allegedly shot dead by a friend in Delhi as they posed with a pistol to make a video to show on TikTok, police told Indian media.Three friends were driving in Delhi, when one pulled out a homemade pistol and aimed it at the driver. Police said the gun accidentally went off, shooting the man through the head.And the moves in India to ban Tiktok are the latest in a string of woes for the popular app.Bangladesh banned Tiktok in February as part of a clampdown on internet pornography.The same month, the US Federal Trade Commission said a $5.7m fine ordered against Tiktok was the largest imposed in a child privacy investigation.The social network failed to obtain parental consent from underage users as required by the US Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, FTC officials said."},

The proposed reforms, which were moved swiftly through committee hearings and parliamentary debates, would grant Sisi control over the judiciary, increase the military’s political power and extend presidential terms to six years.The former general, who became president in 2014 after a coup the previous year, was re-elected in 2018 with 97.8% of the vote. His attempt to extend his rule comes as autocrats in neighbouring Sudan and Algeria have fallen to popular protests after decades in power.Posters urging Egyptians to vote yes to the proposed changes began appearing across Cairo more than a week ago. “A bright future, a better tomorrow,” declared one poster. “Yes to the constitutional amendments. Yes to stability and development,” extolled another, showing Sisi’s face and a bright red tick within an ornate frame.No banners showing dissent were visible on the streets, and members of the country’s fragile opposition said they were prevented from campaigning openly.“Right now the country needs stability, and from what I understand, these constitutional amendments will bring stability,” said Mohamed al-Sharkawi, a restaurant owner who hung a banner of support for a yes vote in his restaurant.During a hearing in February, 485 out of 596 MPs  the bill. What little criticism was permitted in previous debate stages, during which one MP described the changes as “medieval” and said they would aid autocratic rule, has since been all but silenced.Egypt’s only independent media outlet, Mada Masr, said a national dialogue on the changes included only those who “”.Instead, most MPs restricted their  to a package of proposed changes designed to sweeten the vote, such as introducing a 25% quota of parliamentary seats for women.Khaled Dawoud, of the opposition Constitution party, said the sudden support for a referendum that had yet to be declared “proves the entire process is a ploy and that the result is known in advance. It’s not just that a date hasn’t been set, but even the final draft of the amendments hasn’t yet been approved by parliament.”A coalition of the Constitution party and the Civil Democratic Movement which was created to oppose the changes said its attempts to show dissent had been suffocated. Ten Constitution party members were arrested for opposing the amendments.“A total of nearly 120 people were arrested from legal opposition parties and other pro-democracy groups,” Dawoud said.The parliamentary speaker, Ali Abdel Aal,  the Ahram Online news outlet the referendum could begin as soon as 22 April, a week after the proposed vote. “In ruling circles the referendum is being seen as a vote of confidence in President al-Sisi and his regime,” he said.“It’s depressing,” said Tarek Salama, a former member of the pro-government Free Egyptians party, who used social media to call on people to vote against the changes. “All of this is completely organised by the security services,” he said. “It’s about giving the impression that everyone will say yes – it’s not about whether it moves people or not.”Egyptian authorities repeatedly  a website that had reportedly garnered more than 100,000 signatures in opposition to the changes.Salama said: “If Sisi would allow a free referendum, he would win, but with an image that he’s a democrat. But you have to understand, he wants to prove he’s strong.”One 32-year-old man, who was not named for safety reasons, told the Guardian he would vote for the first time in years. “I’m going to vote, just so I can vote no,” he said. “I’m not hopeful, but I won’t forgive myself if I don’t go.”Timothy Kaldas, of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, said the referendum presented a rare opportunity to show dissent at the ballot box, despite few expectations the process would be fair. “Unlike opposition candidates in the last election, the government can’t imprison the word no,” he said."},

He rejected partial denuclearisation steps offered by Kim, which included an offer to dismantle Yongbyon.Although Kim has maintained a freeze on missile and nuclear tests since 2017, US officials say North Korea has continued to produce fissile material that can be processed for use in bombs.In March a senior North Korean official warned that .Last week Kim said the Hanoi breakdown raised the risks of reviving tensions, adding that he was only interested in meeting Trump again if the United States came with the right attitude.Kim said he would  for the United States to decide to be more flexible.

No product has suffered like this one. But again, what the hell do I know?”Trump knows like the rest of the world that the 737 Max has given Boeing a serious problem.The US and other countries grounded the 737 Max in mid-March after deadly crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia. Boeing aims to finish fixing the planes in late April, and any changes would have to be submitted to the Federal Aviation Administration and foreign regulators for approval.Sunday’s announcement made American the second major carrier to cancel Max flights through the busy summer. Southwest Airlines, the largest operator of Boeing jets, announced last week that it would cancel its Max flights through 5 August. American’s cancellations will last through 19 August.American had planned to cancel Max flights through early June. By extending cancellations through the summer the airline can plan more reliably for the peak travel season, said Doug Parker, American’s chairman and chief executive, and Robert Isom, president, in a letter to employees.Airlines are being forced to ground their planes longer than expected after Boeing and the FAA said the company needs more time to complete changes to a flight-control system suspected of playing a role in the crashes.American’s cancellations represent 1.5% of its total flights each day of the summer. The airline, which has 24 Max jets, said reservations and sales teams will work with customers to manage their travel plans.American explained on its website that not all flights previously scheduled on a Max would be canceled, because the airline plans to substitute other aircraft for some flights. That also means some flights that were not scheduled to take place on a Max plane may be canceled because the airline aims to affect the smallest number of customers.American also said on its website that customers can request a full refund if they choose not to be rebooked.On Twitter, American Airlines passengers posted complaints about canceled flights affecting vacations, speaking engagements and travel to funerals and noted problems rebooking flights.American canceled 350 out of Dallas-Fort Worth on Saturday, but that had nothing to do with the Max, said a spokesman, Ross Feinstein. The cancellations were caused by hail, thunderstorms and high winds in Dallas followed by snow in Chicago, he said.“We’re working as hard as possible to rebook customers,” Feinstein said."},

The idea has been  on a national stage this year, among  for the Democratic presidential nomination.Results  showed two-thirds of Georgetown undergraduates who voted in a non-binding referendum said payments should be funded in their case by a fee that would apply to all undergraduate students.Richard Cellini, founder of the , which has raised money to identify thousands of descendants of the people sold in 1838, told the Guardian the vote was “momentous”.“It makes me very proud of the students,” he said. “My guess is that the university will do what it’s always done, which is soft-talk and slow-walk this, but I hope I’m wrong.”What’s impressive about the students is that they acted … They put their money where their mouth was.In an open letter to “Members of the Georgetown University community”, the , said: “Over the past four years, we have been working to respond to Georgetown’s historical relationship to the institution of slavery and engaging with members of the Descendant community of the enslaved people of the Maryland Jesuit plantations.“Yesterday, our undergraduate students voted on a student referendum proposing the idea of a fund for Descendants created by a new student fee that would apply to all undergraduate students.”Noting that the favourable vote was non-binding, he said: “This moment raises complex issues that we are prepared to grapple with and embrace. Our students are bringing attention to deeply held convictions that we take very seriously.”DeGioia said he would “engage key leaders in our Georgetown, Descendant and Jesuit communities and our faculty, board, and student leadership to chart a path forward”.He also noted college “efforts” on the matter since 2015 that he said had “begun the work of memorializing and reconciling the legacies of slavery that have shaped our community and our nation on the issue”.These included a 2016 meeting with “descendants of the children, women, and men enslaved on Maryland plantations and sold by the Maryland Jesuits in 1838”; a  for “our participation in the evil of slavery”, made in 2017; and “a new process of engagement that is helping us to develop a long-term framework for dialogue and collaboration among our communities”, begun in 2018.DeGioia said the university was now “pursuing work that is uncharted” and “forging a new path towards reconciliation.“This work requires the best of our energies and the commitment of time,” he said. “The transformation that is invited in this moment will not happen immediately or easily.”Cellini said DeGioia’s letter was “filled with jargon”.“What’s impressive about the students,” he said, “is that they affirmatively and proactively acted. They did something. They put their money where their mouth was.”Cellini, who said he was a moderate Republican, said he had no personal connection to the history of the “Georgetown 272”, other than his undergraduate and law degrees.“We believe Georgetown University and the Maryland Jesuits owe reparations and restitution to the descendants of their former slaves,” he said, adding that one of the school’s dormitories, which he said generates more than $1m in revenue every year, was built and paid for with the proceeds of the 1838 sales of enslaved people.“This isn’t about something that happened a long time ago,” Cellini said. “It’s not a question about whether the past is the past.

Each company listed is given a number for the type of hours they tend to push, in some cases beyond the 996 work schedule.Ant Financial, a financial services company affiliated with , is listed as having a “9106” work schedule – starting at 9am, ending at 10pm, for six days a week. In another case, staff at a software firm in Shandong province said they were required to work more than 100 hours of overtime in a month.The long hours at Chinese tech firms are a relatively new development as China’s tech industry has expanded with startups modelling themselves more after those in Silicon Valley.Chinese tech companies are known for encouraging an obsession with work:  reportedly promotes an aggressive, cut-throat “” among its ranks.Chinese tech executives have defended the long hours at their companies. , the founder of Alibaba, one of the companies included in the blacklist, called the 996 schedule “a huge blessing” and said workers should consider it an honour rather than a burden.“If you join Alibaba, you should get ready to work 12 hours a day. Otherwise why did you come to Alibaba? We don’t need those who comfortably work eight hours,” he said, according to comments posted on the company’s Wechat account on Friday.Richard Liu, the founder of the Chinese e-commerce company JD.com, also defended the 996 schedule. In a note on Friday, Liu recalled how in the early days of the company he would wake up every two hours so that he could offer customers a 24-hour service.Liu said that since then, the number of “slackers” in his company had grown. “If this carries on, JD will have no hope and the company will be heartlessly kicked out of the market! Slackers are not my brothers.”As China’s economy has slowed and bubbles have emerged in the tech sector, more employees are starting to reconsider the merits of working long hours.“They [employees] were willing to accept long hours when business was good and they were being well rewarded but that is not the case any more. Staff are being laid off and pay is stagnating so staff are less willing to work as hard,” said Geoffrey Crothall of  Labour Bulletin.The debate has spread across Chinese social media, where many users have criticised the tech industry’s work culture as “inhumane”. Even Chinese state media has weighed in. In an editorial on Sunday the People’s Daily said: “Employees who object to 996 cannot be labelled as ‘slackers’ or ‘not fighters’. Their real needs should be considered.”The topic has also prompted a broader debate about the kind of work-life balance – or lack of it – engendered by Chinese companies.One user commented on the discussion forum Zhihu: “Most of today’s companies are machines that cannot stop running. We are all screws on top. If the screw is rusty, just polish it, put a little lubricant on, then twist it on again and use it. If it breaks, they’ll find a new screw to replace you. The machine cannot stop.”"},

Protesters said they had joined hands and formed a ring around the sit-in area on Monday after troops gathered on three sides and tractors were preparing to remove stone and metal barricades.Clips posted on social media showed a lengthy standoff as several thousand protesters chanted “freedom, freedom” and “revolution, revolution”, and appealed to the army to protect them.Earlier, the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) protest group issued an urgent call for people to join the sit-in and block any attempt to disperse it. “We hope that everyone will head immediately to the areas of the sit-in to protect your revolution and your accomplishments,” the SPA said.The confrontation came as a series of representatives of western countries, including the UK and US, had their first meetings with Sudan’s new rulers, while the African Union issued a statement calling for the army to give way to a civilian government within two weeks.The sit-in outside the compound, which also includes the intelligence headquarters and the presidential residence, began on 6 April after more than three months of protests triggered by a deepening economic crisis.On Thursday, Sudan’s army announced it had removed and detained Bashir after three decades in power and was setting up a transitional military council to run the country.Since then the heads of the council and  have both been replaced, as protesters have continued to call for change. The SPA has demanded the immediate handover of power to a civilian transitional government and the prosecution of former officials.The military council met political parties on Sunday and urged them to agree on an “independent figure” to be prime minister, an AFP correspondent at the meeting said. “We want to set up a civilian state based on freedom, justice and democracy,” one council member, Lt Gen Yasser al-Ata, told members of several political parties.A 10-member delegation representing the protesters delivered a list of demands during talks with the council late on Saturday, according to a statement by the Alliance for Freedom and Change umbrella group. But in a press conference the council’s spokesman did not respond to the protesters’ latest demands.The western diplomats angered some protesters by meeting Gen Mohammad Hamdan Daglo, the deputy chief of the military council. Widely known as Himeidti, he heads the feared Rapid Support Force (RSF) that grew out of the  accused of abuses in Darfur.The British ambassador  that he had met with Daglo “not to endorse or confer legitimacy … but to stress steps UK wants to see taken to improve situation in Sudan.”Irfan Siddiq said he had made clear there should be “no violence and no attempt to forcibly break the sit-in”, a swift formation of a civilian transitional government through a transparent, credible and inclusive process, and clarity on the whereabouts of Bashir and other former senior regime figures.“Transparency builds confidence. Finally, expressed concerns about historic role of RSF. Allegations of abuses and crimes need to be addressed to build confidence,” Siddiq wrote.Washington’s chargé d’affaires in Khartoum, Steven Koutsis, met Daglo on Sunday.The African Union of countries has taken a harder line, condemning the “unconstitutional” military takeover and threatening to suspend  from the organisation if civilian rule is not restored within 15 days.Many regional powers are nervous of instability in Sudan causing further problems in an already volatile region."},

Many women fear that if the group regains some power, many of these gains could be erased.The movement came to power in the 1990s and gained worldwide notoriety by forcing women to wear a full facial covering and imposing severe restrictions including banning girls from school and forbidding women from working outside the home.However, Taliban spokesmen say the group has changed and encourages girls’ education and other women’s rights within an Islamic sharia system.Civil society groups, the western-backed government and Afghanistan’s international partners have pressed for women to take part in the talks and news of the Taliban delegation was welcomed. Fawzia Koofi, a former member of the Afghan parliament who took part in a previous round of meetings in Moscow, said the presence of women in the Taliban team was a “good step”.“Only women can feel the pain and miseries that Afghan women have suffered. The presence of women among the Taliban negotiators shows that the Taliban’s ideology has changed,” she said.Jeanne Shaheen, a member of the US Senate armed services committee, who has been pressing for women to play a role in the peace talks, said such inclusion would be vital for future international support for Afghanistan.“There are certain levers that we have, that the Taliban are interested in,” she told reporters in Kabul, where she was visiting as part of a congressional delegation. “There is going to be an interest in economic support after the conflict ends.“I think if the Taliban has any interest in getting international support … it would be in their interest to recognise the importance of including women and including human rights as part of any settlement that happens.”"},

Some orthodox Muslims regard the Ahmadi as heretical because they do not believe Muhammad was the final prophet sent to guide mankind.During the programmes broadcast by Channel 44 in early December 2017, Ofcom said the guest “made remarks that attributed conspiratorial intent to the actions of the Pakistani authorities towards the Ahmadiyya community”.Ofcom found the channel breached three clauses in its code, covering context of offensive material, hate speech, and derogatory treatment of religions or communities.Arguing that Pakistani officials had “inducted” Ahmadi people into the police and education department, the guest called on the country’s people to “rise up” against this. Among other inflammatory remarks, he also claimed that until the Ahmadi community suffers “a bad ending, matters will not improve”.City News Network (SMC) Pvt Ltd, which runs the channel, was fined £75,000 and ordered to broadcast a statement about the ruling. The firm expressed its “regret and sincere apologies for the failings in the compliance for these two programmes”. It described the failings as unintentional and said it did not intend to cause offence to the Ahmadi community.Last year, a community radio station was fined £10,000 after broadcasting “abusive and derogatory” statements about the Ahmadis. Radio Ikhlas, based in Derby, suspended a presenter and broadcast an apology after a radio phone-in that discussed the beliefs of the Ahmadi community in offensive and pejorative terms.During the 21-minute segment, the presenter described Ahmadi people as “dangerous, liars, enemies and hypocrites”.In 2013 a TV station was fined £25,000 after broadcasting two programmes subjecting the Ahmadi community to abuse.Takbeer TV, a free-to-air Islamic channel, broadcast statements describing Ahmadis as having “monstrous” intentions and being both “lying monsters” and worthy of elimination by Allah, “by using worms and vermin”."},

Green was his expert witness and the challenge to his deportation was successful – a groundbreaking legal victory.Later, in 1972, Green published a pioneering paper calling for the removal of homosexuality from the ’s list of mental disorders, despite being advised that it would ruin his career. The following year he reiterated his call at the APA annual meeting and the organisation removed homosexuality from the list.He was an early advocate of same-sex marriage, making the case for marriage equality in a debate on the  series The Advocates in 1974, when equal marriage was opposed by 90% of Americans. The same year, in Ohio, in a period when lesbian mothers invariably lost child custody or child visitation rights upon divorce from their husbands, Green was the first expert psychiatric witness in a US court hearing, Hall v Hall, in which the mother was victorious.He went on to testify in more than a dozen similar cases. In 1979 he submitted an affidavit in support of two Californian gay men who wanted to co-adopt a child, during an era when adoption by gay couples was effectively banned. With his help, they scored an important success.Green was also a trailblazing facilitator of gender reassignment surgery. In the mid-1960s he saw patients with , who was then the only American physician treating trans people. In the absence of US medical programmes for transgender people (called transsexuals in those days), Green referred American patients to Europe for surgery.While on sabbatical in Britain in 1980, he participated in the first child visitation rights case, C v G, involving a transgender parent. A father, transitioning to live as a woman, wanted continuing access to his child. The mother objected. Green was the psychiatric expert for the father and helped him win the case.Back in the US, Green became involved when Eastern Airlines refused to permit a pilot, , who had flown as a male for 16 years, to return to the cockpit after gender reassignment to become a woman. Green was an expert psychiatric witness for the pilot, and won the initial case in 1983, although it was later overturned on appeal.After graduating in his 50s from Yale Law School, which he attended from 1984 to 1987, Green merged his psychiatric work on sex and gender with law, and in 1992 tackled the subject in a book called Sexual Science and the Law. As a newly qualified lawyer he worked with the American Civil Liberties Union and in 1990 was co-counsel in one of the first legal challenges against homophobic discrimination by the Boy Scouts of America. They were refusing to permit a gay man, Tim Curran, to be an assistant scoutmaster; the Boy Scouts won, and the ban on gay men remained in place until 2014.In 1991 Green wrote an affidavit in support of Joseph Steffan, a star student at the US Naval Academy who had been refused graduation after it was revealed that he was gay. The case for his reinstatement was lost, and it was not until 2011 that gay men were finally accepted into the military.Green was born in , New York, to Leo, an accountant for the International Ladies’ Garment Workers Union and Rose Ingber, who was a teacher and later a civil servant. He was raised as a secular Jew. He attended Syracuse University from 1957 until 1961, becoming the first graduate of that university to be accepted at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, securing his place in an era when the school limited Jewish students to 10% of the total enrolment.As a medical student at Johns Hopkins, Green studied with the innovative sex and gender psychologist . When later training to be a psychiatrist at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), he collaborated with Robert Stoller, an expert in gender identity. He completed his psychiatry training at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Maryland, 1964-66, and was then awarded a fellowship assignment at the Maudsley hospital in London, 1966-67. Throughout his career he held many academic posts, including as professor of psychiatry emeritus at UCLA and visiting professor of psychiatry at Imperial College, London. Among Green’s publications, which include eight books and 200 papers and textbook chapters, he co-edited the first multidisciplinary text (Transsexualism and Sex Reassignment) on what was then referred to as sex change. His studies of transgender adults and gender non-conformist boys were documented in Sexual Identity Conflict in Children and Adults (1974); later his book The Sissy Boy Syndrome and the Development of Homosexuality (1987) examined the tormented, stigmatised childhoods of feminine boys, who, by and large, matured into gay men.Detailed accounts of his many medical and legal battles were collected in his last book, Gay Rights, Trans Rights: A Psychiatrist/Lawyer’s 50-year Battle (2018).He is survived by his son, Adam, from his marriage to Melissa Hines, which ended in divorce in 2014.

Their own financial interventions have helped destroy that country,” Pompeo added, claiming Chinese money had been used to pay off Maduro’s cronies, crush pro-democracy activists and fund ineffective social programs.China, which is Venezuela’s biggest foreign creditor and is estimated to have provided up to $62bn (£47bn) of loans since 2007, reacted angrily.The foreign ministry spokesman, Lu Kang, slammed Pompeo’s “groundless allegations” and “attempts to slander China and sow discord between China and Latin American countries”.“The US has long been treating Latin America as its backyard, where it would resort to willful use of pressure, threat or even subversion. People can tell right from wrong. I am sure Latin American countries are fully capable of telling a true friend from a false one who is ignoring rules and spreading chaos,” Lu told a press conference in Beijing on Monday, according to .China’s ambassador to Chile, Xu Bu, was even less diplomatic. “Mr Pompeo has lost his mind,” he  the Chilean newspaper La Tercera.As Pompeo concluded his tour of Chile, Colombia, Paraguay and Peru on Sunday, Juan Guaidó, the US-backed opposition leader currently battling to dislodge Maduro,  to China to abandon Hugo Chávez’s authoritarian heir.Guaidó, who is recognized as Venezuela’s legitimate interim leader by more than 50 governments, said Beijing would find “a willing, open and more reliable partner in Caracas” if it backed him.Analysts suspect China’s pragmatic Communist party leaders – who engage with governments of all stripes across Latin America – would not mourn Maduro’s downfall.However, almost three months after Guaidó  on 23 January, there is no sign of that happening, with Venezuela’s military and world powers such as China, Russia and Turkey continuing to offer support.Lu, the foreign ministry spokesman, indicated that US “smear” campaigns would not change that.“A lie will remain a lie, even if repeated a thousand times,” he told reporters. “Monsieur Pompeo might as well take a break.”"},
{"title": "Letters: Dr Zareer Masani takes issue with an article by Mihir Bose, Judy Stober says it is a delusion that Britain has been a world leader in establishing a just and tolerant society, but Randhir Singh Bains thinks there is little point in apologising for the 1919 massacre", "time": "Mon 15 Apr 2019 ", "category": "World", "tags": "India,British empire,Theresa May,South and Central Asia,Military,letters", "content": "May I point out several factual errors in Mihir Bose’s article on the 1919 Amritsar massacre (, 13 April)?Gandhi never described British rule as “satanic” then or ever. The Liberal-led coalition government in London did indeed intend dominion status for  and introduced liberal reforms to that end the same year. The repressive Rowlatt Act never came into force.It’s a typically emotive myth that 41 women died in the horrendous massacre. Punjabi women of the time, mostly in purdah, never ventured out in the midst of riots and curfew. Nationalist sources record only two female fatalities. Prince Philip’s questioning of the casualty figures now being touted is supported by most historians.The massacre was condemned at the time as “a monstrosity” and “un-British” by the House of Commons and the Hunter judicial inquiry appointed by the Raj itself. General Dyer’s boss, the secretary of state for war Winston Churchill, led the condemnation and insisted on him being forced out of the army.Bose doesn’t mention the crucial facts that five British civilians were bludgeoned to death and a British female charity worker was stripped, beaten and left for dead by Indian mobs in the violence leading up to the massacre. That was why so many wrongly saw Dyer as a saviour.Indians demanding British apologies today might stop to consider that the grandfather of the Sikh maharaja of Patiala, now Congress chief minister of Punjab and leading the chorus, publicly backed Dyer at the time. So did the Sikh Golden Temple, which felicitated him on the massacre and made him an honorary Sikh. If apologies are in order, they should start at home in India. The articles by Mihir Bose and Myriam François (, 13 April) could have gone further.Another of the problems, both in acknowledging our culpability of past actions as happened at Jallianwala Bagh and the response to Jon Snow’s remark, is the fact that we are constantly told that Britain has been a world leader in establishing a just and tolerant society. This is a delusion. The reality is that for centuries every new group of people coming to the UK has been vilified. Just in my living experience this has included the Poles who came during the second world war, Caribbean and Asian people from the late 1940s onwards and now, of course, people from eastern Europe.Myriam François is also right to point to structural (or institutional) racism, which very few people seem willing to accept as a concept, let alone be prepared to confront and take action to overcome. One of the clearest examples is the Home Office, which we know has been institutionally racist since at least the time of the Windrush generation. Rather than taking action to rectify the problems, , when she was home secretary, only exacerbated the situation by introducing the idea of an “hostile environment” – a euphemism if ever there was one – which almost certainly influenced some people into voting for Brexit. The legacy of Amritsar, Mihir Bose’s claim notwithstanding, is neither ignored nor forgotten. David Cameron expressed regret for it in 2013, as did Theresa May last week. But both refused to apologise – and it is not difficult to see why.Regret expresses a desire that the event had not taken place, without any acceptance of wrongdoing on one’s part. An apology, on the other hand, amounts to an admission of guilt and unlawful activity. Regret, for example, would not be appropriate for crimes such as Japan’s mistreatment of prisoners of war or the Turkish genocide of Armenians, for in these cases both states not only failed to protect victims, but also failed to punish the guilty.The British state in 1919, however, did deliver justice. The man responsible for the Amritsar massacre was duly charged and punished. One wishes the massacre had not taken place, but it did, and the culprit was appropriately dealt with. Since Britain neither collaborated in nor wilfully ignored the crime committed by General Dyer – in fact, it paid liberal compensations to the relatives of the victims of the massacre – there is little point in apologising."},
{"title": "Mira Marković obituary", "time": "Mon 15 Apr 2019 ", "category": "Europe", "tags": "Serbia,Europe,Bosnia-Herzegovina,Slobodan Milosevic trial,Nazism,Second world war,obituaries", "content": "Her first name means “peace”. Yet Mira Marković, who has died aged 76, wife of the former Yugoslav leader , was at least as responsible as her husband for the wars and bloodshed that marked the breakup of their country in the 1990s.When Milošević’s party lost local elections in 1996, it was Marković who persuaded her husband to overrule the poll. She did the same again when he lost elections in 2000, in the wake of the Nato bombing campaign that led to the withdrawal of Serbian troops from Kosovo.“Milošević has never had any political ideas of his own,” the former president of Yugoslavia  and Milošević’s sometime mentor, said in an interview not long before he was kidnapped in 2000 (his body was found in 2003). “They’ve all been hers.” Marković and Milošević met as teenagers at school in their home town, Požarevac, in eastern , and from the beginning of their intense relationship, Marković was seen as the dominant partner.Her influence over Milošević might not have been so cataclysmic for the Balkans had she been a more stable woman. But she was deeply psychologically scarred by the death of her mother, Vera Miletić, a second world war communist partisan fighter who was captured by the Nazis in Yugoslavia in 1944. Miletić reputedly betrayed her communist comrades when tortured by the Gestapo and the partisans ordered her execution after the Germans released her. Her daughter, Mirjana, who was then two years old, later took the name Mira in memory of her mother, who had used it as her nom de guerre. The story goes that a bowl of flowers was on the table in the family home on the day that Vera was taken away to be shot, and that is why Mira often wore a flower in her raven-dark back-combed hair. Her father, Milomir Marković, also a former partisan fighter, refused to acknowledge his daughter until she was 15 years old, and she was raised by an aunt. She spent much of her life trying to clear her mother’s reputation and all documents referring to Vera disappeared when Milošević began his rise to power in the late 80s.Against this background, Marković formed an instant and lifelong bond with the young Milošević, whose own parents had depression and who both took their own lives. The teenage Slobodan was already hungry for political power and spent his time forging contacts with the party elite in Požarevac. Milošević, a law student, and Marković, who gained a PhD in sociology, studied at Belgrade University and married in 1965. Marković, who would later be known as the Red Witch and the Lady Macbeth of Belgrade, took to dressing in black and reading Dostoevsky and Sartre. The couple had two children, a daughter, Marija, and a son, Marko. Marko, whom she called “my wild mustang”, went on to build a multimillion-pound business empire. He fled in 2000 after his father’s fall from power and was granted refugee status in Russia.Marković’s relationship with her daughter was often strained. “My mother believes in a communist utopia,” Marija told me wryly in 2002, “where no one needs money and every day is sunny.” Marković herself developed more capitalist tastes, however, with a penchant for fur coats, caviar and expensive chocolate.As their married life progressed, Marković fiercely fought for Milošević’s promotion within the Communist party hierarchy. When he took control of the party from Stambolić in 1987, the betrayal of his mentor would have been with the approval, if not at the suggestion, of his wife.Marković, meanwhile, became a teacher of sociology at Belgrade University and wrote numerous books and a rambling column in the Belgrade press, which she used to launch diatribes against her political enemies. It became required reading for anyone interested in knowing who was in or out of favour.As the wars in Croatia, Bosnia and finally Kosovo broke out through the 90s, Marković frequently accused foreign forces of plotting Serbia’s demise. She launched vicious verbal attacks on any Serbian critics of Milošević, accusing them of being “criminally insane”. Her name was linked with the disappearance and death of some high-profile critics, including , a newspaper editor who turned against Milošević in the runup to the Nato bombardment of Yugoslavia, and Stambolić.As the war in Bosnia ended in 1995, Marković founded her own political party, the Yugoslav United Left (JUL), which governed in coalition with Milošević’s Socialist party. JUL ran the television station TV Pink, which broadcast pop and rock music, and imported films and programmes such as Only Fools and Horses. As opposition to Milošević’s regime grew through the latter half of the 90s, the station’s aim was to persuade Serbia’s young people to forget about politics and concentrate on having fun.After Milošević was  and  to face war crimes charges in 2001, Marković described the tribunal as “the new Gestapo”. The couple spoke daily by telephone and she made frequent visits to see her husband in prison until, in 2003, facing charges herself, she  Serbia, and did not return after  to attend his funeral in Požarevac. She joined Marko in exile in Russia, where she remained until her death.She is survived by Marko and Marija.

Voters chose between 2,500 candidates from 19 political parties and movements.The result was further evidence of a modest social democratic fightback in Nordic countries, with left-leaning prime ministers now in power and , and the Social Democrats leading in the polls in Denmark, where elections are due this summer.The biggest loser was the Centre party of the outgoing prime minister Juha Sipilä, who blamed the slump in its support – to 13.8% of the vote and fourth place – on the “difficult economic decisions” his government had had to make.Ninety-two of the 200 MPs in the new parliament are women, the second highest proportion in Europe after .Although the SDP’s victory is its first in 20 years, with no party winning more than 20% of the vote and deep divisions within all mainstream parties over the future of Finland’s widely admired welfare system – which the left want to preserve by increasing taxes, and the right to streamline because of rising costs – the centre-left party may find it hard to build a sustainable coalition.Final results will be published on Wednesday, with formal coalition talks likely to start on 25 April. The leader of the party with the most seats traditionally has the first stab at forming a government.Political analysts expect a coalition led by the Social Democrats, possibly including the conservative National Coalition, a junior member of the outgoing coalition, which won 38 seats, the Greens and the Swedish People’s party.The more radical Left Alliance might also seek to join the cabinet, but the Centre party’s heavy defeat is likely to exclude it. All parties have said they would find it difficult, if not impossible, to share power with the Finns party and its hardline leader, Jussi Halla-aho, who has shifted the party firmly to the right since a 2017 split that saw half its MPs leave.Rinne said his party disagreed with the Finns party on immigration, the EU, and economic policy, as well as, most importantly, in their core values. “I don’t think we can work with the Finns because of those differences,” he told Agence France-Presse, adding that he expected to be able to instead strike a deal with either the conservative National Coalition or the Centre party.“It’s very hard to see that the other parties would say no to the Social Democrats, because then we would be in a situation with Halla-aho trying to form a government and I just don’t see that happening,” said a political commentator, Sini Korpinen.Markku Jokisipilä, professor of political history at the University of Turku, said other parties were “at present rejecting the possibility of being in the same government with the Finns party. But it remains to be seen, because Finnish politics is rather pragmatic.”Halla-aho told the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper that although he could be interested in the job of interior minister, he would not repeat the mistakes his party made in 2015 when it haemorrhaged support after entering government and had to compromise on immigration and EU bailouts.“I don’t see it as possible that the Finns party would take part in a government which doesn’t clearly commit to reducing humanitarian migration,” he said.The strong finish by the Finns party, which was in fifth place in the polls less than six months ago, echoed similar recent performances by hard-right, anti-immigration parties across .Halla-aho, who has transformed the party from being a populist Eurosceptic movement to a far more explicitly nationalist, far-right organisation that aims to cut immigration to “almost zero” and questions the need for tough action on climate change, ended up winning the most votes of any candidate in the election.Halla-aho, 47, who was fined by the supreme court in 2012 for blog comments linking Islam to paedophilia and Somalis to theft, has said the next government should not speed up cutting carbon emissions but instead pursue a “more moderate climate policy that does not chase industries away from Finland to countries like China”.The Finns party is among a number of populist far-right parties, including Germany’s far-right ,  and the , to announce plans to join forces after the European parliamentary elections on 23-26 May in an attempt to transform EU policies on migration, families and the environment."},

A candidate from the regional Samajwadi party, Azam Khan, had  by saying his female BJP opponent wore “khaki underwear”, a suggestion she was downplaying her Hindu nationalist beliefs. The uniform of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, India’s largest Hindu nationalist group, includes khaki shorts or trousers.The commission banned him from the campaign trail for 72 hours, calling his comments “not only indecent but also derogatory and totally uncalled for”.A cabinet minister, Maneka Gandhi, was also banned for two days after video emerged showing her  in her electorate that if she won office without their votes, “then when a Muslim comes to me for work, I will think, let it be, how does it matter?” Gandhi said the comments were taken out of context.Indian law bans political candidates from appealing to voters based on egregious remarks about religion or the caste system. But in practice, these social categories are still defining faultlines in Indian life and are frequently referenced in political speeches.The six-week election season that started last week has been rife with incendiary religious appeals, particularly from the BJP, whose overarching political goal is to forge a cohesive political identity out of the country’s extraordinarily diverse community of about 1 billion Hindus.Adityanath, who spent time in jail in 2007 on charges of fomenting anti-Muslim riots, had already received a warning from the authorities for referring to India’s armed forces as “Modi’s army”, in breach of guidelines against casting political aspersions on the institution.On Thursday, the BJP president, Amit Shah, told supporters at a rally in Assam state that if re-elected the party would rid India of unauthorised migrants – , Hindus and Sikhs. The government is proposing a bill to fast-track asylum requests for refugees who follow those three religions, but not for Muslims.We will ensure implementation of NRC in the entire country. We will remove every single infiltrator from the country, except Buddha, Hindus and Sikhs: Shri  Shah also referred to unauthorised migrants from Bangladesh as “termites”, language he had used in another speech in September, and which was highlighted by the US state department in its annual human rights review.India’s supreme court said on Monday it would examine whether election authorities had enough power to clamp down on hate speech."},

The new border confirmed several former and operational fields were in Timorese territory, .At the time of the signing, Australia insisted the treaty would not take effect until both countries had ratified it. But the Australian government has now failed to ratify the deal before the announcement of the federal election. Critics have blamed this on the “dysfunction” of the Coalition government and 45th parliament.The delay has meant that Australia continues to draw profits from the Bayu-Undan fields, which had previously been split 90-10 but was confirmed by the treaty to have belonged entirely to Timor-Leste.Estimates vary between $350,000 and $2.9m per week that Australia is drawing by continuing to claim 10% of the Bayu-Undan revenue.“This is pretty outrageous when it comes to one of our poorest neighbours,” said Steve Bracks, the former Victorian premier and founder of the Timor-Leste governance project. “They’re being denied that money because of the dysfunction of the Australian government and its insistence that parliament needs to ratify the treaty.”Timor-Leste is the second-most oil-dependent country on earth but its reserves are expected to run out first.  and stave off the crisis of losing the 90% share of its annual budget that come from the Petroleum Fund – primarily Bayu-Undan profits.Bracks, who is also an occasional adviser to Timor-Leste, called on Australia’s main political parties to commit to repaying the money collected since March 2018 when the treaty was signed.The Labor party, which is expected to win the election, did not respond to requests for comment.The foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, did not say if a re-elected Coalition government would repay the money. However, she said both countries were working to finalise the necessary arrangements.“The Coalition government tabled the first tranche of legislation in parliament last year and the Senate economics committee recommended on 8 February that it be passed,” Payne said. “Work is under way on the second tranche of legislation, which will be finalised after negotiations on extensive transitional arrangements with the affected companies have been concluded.”However, Bracks said that was not necessary to enable Timor-Leste to receive the revenue it was entitled to.“Under executive fiat they could have just proceeded [with the new arrangements] but instead Australia insisted the parliaments of both countries ratify this,” he said.L’ao Hamutuk, a Dili-based human rights organisation, said both countries could have ratified the treaty in August – when Timor-Leste’s new parliament began sitting and when the Australian joint select committee on the treaty published its report.“But in the next seven months Australia received US$44m from Bayu-Undan,” said Charles Scheiner, of L’ao Hamutuk. “If ratification doesn’t happen until the end of July 2019 [the next sitting dates after the Australian federal election], this will grow to about US$76m.“If the treaty had been ratified expeditiously, the Bayu-Undan revenue no longer being siphoned off by Australia would have covered the health costs of the entire Timorese population.”The treaty ended a decades-long negotiation process that included , and  when it decided to legitimise the Indonesian invasion of Timor-Leste.Bracks accused the government of continuing to obfuscate and insist on a previous arrangement “forged under industrial espionage”.L’ao Hamutuk estimated last year that Australia had taken billions of dollars in revenue over the decades that negotiations continued – money that should have been Timor-Leste’s and which has not been requested back by the tiny island nation in what Bracks described as an “act of goodwill”.Last year, a Timorese diplomatic source told the Guardian Timor-Leste was unlikely to push for compensation because of Australia’s generosity during “difficult times”, but added: “If Australia wanted to give it to Timor, then that would be nice.”Bracks said that “on any fair reasoning” it should be repaid, but Timor-Leste was not asking for that, which made the revelation that Australia was continuing to earn revenue from Bayu-Undan even more outrageous."},

We need to be united and firm in blocking the war of aggression of Haftar, a man who has betrayed Libya and the international community.“There are not only the 800,000 migrants potentially ready to leave, there would be Libyans fleeing this war, and in the south of Libya the terrorists of the Islamic State that the Tripoli government with the support of the city of Misrata  from the town of Sirte three years ago”.Sarraj said Haftar’s foreign-funded forces “are attacking civilian structures, roads, schools, houses, the airport and medical facilities: ambulances and hospitals. General Haftar says he is attacking terrorists, but there are only civilians here.”He added: “Haftar’s treacherous action will bring destruction to Libya and neighbouring countries; no negotiation will be possible if its attack on the population does not cease and if it does not withdraw.”The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, meeting supporters of the Sarraj government in Rome, underlined the scale of the problem. He said: “We must avert a humanitarian crisis that could be devastating, not only for the repercussions on  and the EU but in the interests of the Libyan people themselves.” from Libya to Italy fell severely more than a year ago, in part due to deals made by the previous Italian government. Between January and 10 April this year, 551 migrants reached Italy.The UN International Organization for Migration said it was impossible to predict how many migrants might flee Libya and head for Europe. The IOM pointed out that Italy was able to welcome more than 6,000 migrants per month up until 2017. But that level of migration prompted a political backlash, and the interior minister, Matteo Salvini, has built his popularity on a .At least 147 people have been killed and 614 wounded in the offensive launched by Haftar on 4 April to take Tripoli, the World Health Organization said.The clashes have also displaced more than 18,000 people, according to the latest figures from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.The international community remains divided over the best course in Libya, with a coalition of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, France and the United Arab Emirates seeing Haftar as a possible source for stability after years of civil war. These countries highlight the role played by Islamist militia in Tripoli, and insist they want to bring stability to a country that has been overrun by terrorists.But the UN special envoy for Libya, Ghassan Salamé, rejected Haftar’s explanation for his actions, saying the attack resembled a coup rather than a counter-terror operation.Speaking on BBC Radio 4, Salamé said Haftar’s conflict with the Tripoli government “started a long time ago, in fact three or four years ago, in a counter-terrorism logic, but what is happening now is not necessarily a counter-terror logic. It is an attempt clearly to control the capital of the country where one-third of the population lives, at least. This was made even clearer by the fact that he issued a warrant of arrest against the prime minister, Serraj, and others, which sounded like a coup more than counter-terrorism.”Serraj also claimed Tripoli had been locked in a military stalemate over the past eight days with neither side making decisive advances.The acting assistant secretary, US Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, David Satterfield, called for all sides to show restraint, but dialled down previous American criticism of Haftar, and instead emphasised the destructive role of militia, adding that the US favoured an enduring solution."},
{"title": "Canada: police hunt fake deliveryman who shot woman with crossbow", "time": "Mon 15 Apr 2019 ", "category": "Americas", "tags": "Canada,Americas,news", "content": "Police in  are hunting a suspected hitman who they say disguised himself as a delivery person to carry out a “premeditated, targeted and isolated attack” on a woman, gravely injuring her with a crossbow.Details of a brazen murder attempt were released to the public Monday morning by police in Mississauga, Ontario. The attack on the 44-year-old woman occurred late on 7 November 2018 in an area north of Toronto.In black-and-white home surveillance footage, a man is seen carrying a large cardboard box on the victim’s front porch. Dressed in a baseball cap, hooded sweatshirt and dark gloves, the man awkwardly holds the large rectangular box, which police say concealed the crossbow.After a brief conversation, he fires the weapon and flees in a dark pickup truck. The front door is seen closing as the suspect runs away.Despite her substantial injuries, the woman was able to phone emergency responders. She was rushed to a nearby hospital, where she has remained for months.“The injuries that she sustained were absolutely devastating,” Det Sgt Jim Kettles of Peel police told reporters. “It involved damage to a lot of her internal organs. She’ll be in recovery phase for the rest of her life … Her life will never be the same.”The woman got a “direct look” at the man who attacked her, but was unable to identify him.“This was most definitely a targeted type of attack,” Kettles said, adding that “the crossbow was never removed from the box” during the encounter.At the press conference, police displayed a similar crossbow and arrows to the ones used in the attack, which are designed for hunting big game like moose. The choice of weapon was meant to “inflict the maximum amount of damage possible”, said police, who were able to recover one of the arrows at the scene of the crime.“Comments made to the victim [by the suspect] indicate the victim was targeted and that the suspect may have carried out the attack at the request of another individual,” said Supt Heather Raymor. “It is clear that this attack was meant to end the victim’s life.”Police have not released a motive for the attack. Kettles said the shoes and baseball hat worn by the suspect were unique – and the suspect did not conceal his face, giving investigators a number of potential clues. “We are open to anything at this point and we are looking at all possible investigative avenues,” he said."},

The whole of Europe is scarred too", "time": "Mon 15 Apr 2019 ", "category": "Europe", "tags": "Notre Dame,Opinion,Paris,France,Europe,editorials", "content": "t feels as though the very heart of France and the soul of Europe have been suddenly and viciously ripped out. The fire that coursed through large sections of  Cathedral in Paris on Monday evening was an act of blind and terrible destruction that causes a great stab of emotional pain to us all.In a frighteningly short time, it gutted and humbled one of the great buildings of Paris, in an act of annihilation of one of the emblematic places of  that had survived the brutality of the French revolution and the world wars of the 20th century.The fire struck quickly and seemingly uncontrollably. It gathered force with immense power and ferocity, engulfing much of the roof and the central spire as it caught hold. The difficulty of marshalling full and effective firefighting operations to protect the building, which is on a small and historic island in the middle of the Seine, was quickly evident and agonising.After an hour or so, the  fire brigade was able to begin to get part of the fire under some degree of control and to protect the parts of the cathedral that may survive. But, by then, the worst had already taken place. It is not yet clear what will remain of the great building in the cold light of morning although, as night fell, the great west towers still stood against the sky, proud but vulnerable.The pain for the city and its nation will be immense, resonant and almost incomprehensible. Notre Dame is the embodiment of the French capital and of  itself. It has been in its place since the 12th century. It was the site of the marriages of the greatest of all French kings, Henry IV, and of the Emperor Napoleon. It was here that the liberation of Paris in 1944 was marked in a service of thanksgiving.It is world famous not simply as an iconic Parisian building but through the writing of Victor Hugo, who in his novel  – in French the title is simply Notre-Dame de Paris, like the cathedral – made the building itself come alive.Yet the cathedral belongs to us all, too. Notre Dame is intimately connected with the history of England, Scotland and Britain. Henry VI was crowned king of France here. The future François II married Mary Stuart, later Mary, Queen of Scots, in it. Charles I, England’s most reprehensible king, was married in this building, too.But the cathedral is not simply in our history, but in our hearts. It is part of our shared artistic patrimony. It belongs to European civilisation, of which this supremely important medieval building has long been such a peerless artistic embodiment, in the greatness of its carvings, its paintings, its music and its collections.The cruelty of this event to this greatest of European cities is almost beyond rational response. France in 2019 is a badly divided nation. Paris has been the theatre of some of the most vicious acts of terrorist violence of modern times. It is much too early to say what might have caused the conflagration on the Île de la Cité. It would be imprudent to speculate before the facts are known.But those of us in Britain know, from the impact of what happened in the very different circumstances of  two years ago, that such events can come to be seen as something more significant even than a terrible and tragic night of destruction and loss.Notre Dame will rise again. Paris will survive this as it has survived so much else. France will come together, too. But there is no dismissing the traumatic impact of what has happened to French life in Paris in Holy week 2019. A blow has been unleashed to the confidence of a city, a nation, a culture and a continent.The cathedral will rise again in time. This terrible fire is not an event that should be trivialised or banalised. Yet, at a moment like this, how foolish it seems to pretend that we are not all Europeans. We stand with France in its hour of heartbreak. We will never, ever, turn away. This article was amended on 16 April 2019. An earlier version referred to the days running up to Easter as Easter week, instead of Holy week, and said that Notre Dame saw the marriage of Mary Stuart and François I, instead of the future François II."},

It is also where the public celebrates the lives of the great and good.It was at  in 1431 that Henry VI, king of England, was crowned king of France, and James V, king of Scotland, married Madeleine of France in 1537. Requiem masses were held there for presidents Charles de Gaulle and François Mitterrand.The cathedral was immortalised in popular culture by Victor Hugo in his Gothic novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame, later turned into a Disney film.Notre Dame Cathedral was commissioned by King Louis VII who wanted it to be a symbol of Paris’s political, economic, intellectual and cultural power at home and abroad. The city had emerged as the centre of power in  and needed a religious monument to match its new status.A medieval basilica occupying the site chosen by the king at the eastern end of the Île de la Cité, one of two islands in the Seine, was torn down to its foundations so the new cathedral could be built.The first stone of what was to be a massive edifice measuring 130m long and 48m wide, is said to have been laid in 1163, in the presence of Pope Alexander III, but it took another 200 years to complete and underwent frequent modifications in the following centuries.The two towers on the west facade, measuring 69m high, were built in the early 13th century. The north tower is accessible to visitors via a 387-step staircase, while the south tower is home to the cathedral’s 10 bells. Among the most famous of the bells, the  – named Emmanuel – has tolled at most major events in the history of France, including the coronation of kings, papal visits and to mark the end of two world wars.It was also rung to mark the destruction of New York’s Twin Towers on 11 September 2001. The original spire, built around the same time as the towers, was removed in the 18th century but later replaced.Desecrated during the French Revolution, by the early 19th century, the cathedral was crumbling and half-ruined inside. The crowning of Napoleon as emperor followed by the success of Hugo’s novel focused attention on the building, prompting major restorations in the mid-19th century.As well as the wooden rib-vaulted ceiling which has been largely destroyed by the fire, there are fears about the fate of the extraordinary three “rose” stained-glass windows and the many historical artefacts inside the cathedral, including the 17th-century organ. Several precious religious relics, revered by Catholics, were inside the building. On the roof there were a number of beehives.As well as a historic monument and tourist attraction – drawing around 13 million visitors a year - Notre Dame is the heart of the Roman Catholic church in Paris.As the fire raged on Monday evening battled by 400 firefighters, the former mayor of Paris Bertrand Delanoë could barely conceal his emotion saying he was “immensely sad” at the destruction of the cathedral. He added: “It’s an inestimable loss … Notre-Dame de Paris has to live. We must not resign ourselves to this … this is the heritage of all humanity.”"},

The platform introduced the knowledge panel feature in 2018 to cut down on misinformation, but in this case the tool created false associations between fire reportedly caused by accident and the 2001 US-based terrorist attack.The platform’s automated tools may have mistaken the visuals of the burning building for 9/11 footage, according to Vagelis Papalexakis, an assistant professor of computer science and engineering at the University of California, Riverside who studies machine learning used in similar systems.“As long as we are using automated methods to throttle content there is always a margin for mistake,” he said. “This is a multifaceted problem; not only is it working to detect false news but something being falsely associated with 9/11.”YouTube said in a statement it had removed the panels on live streams of the fire following criticism.“We are deeply saddened by the ongoing fire at the  cathedral.

To all of us in Paris, and throughout France, Christians or not, believers or non-believers,  has always meant more than mere Gothic splendour.It is the navel of our country, its historical and geographical centre. All our roads start from here, whatever their destination: it is our focal point, our point zero. We convene in it and around it at our big national moments: to rejoice or to mourn. It is hard to think of a significant moment in the history of our capital that has not involved it.In very recent memory, thousands rallied at Notre Dame in November 2015, after the terrorist attacks tainted  with blood.But for centuries before that dark time, Notre Dame has been a symbol of our national pride and destiny. It was at Notre Dame that the coronation of Napoleon Bonaparte took place, the beatification of Joan of Arc and the funeral masses for Charles de Gaulle and Francois Mitterand. The cathedral stood up to the “grosse Bertha” artillery during the first world war and it stood defiant through the years of Nazi occupation.Victor Hugo wrote his masterpiece in which Quasimodo loved Esmeralda in this place – and in that story, as in the awful reality on Monday, the chapel is eventually consumed by fierce, angry flames.The skies of Paris have turned dark blue, as they were in New York on 9/11. The only cause for relief amid the shock is that there are no dead. And we know too now that the stone structure of the cathedral will hold.The ravaged parts of the church will be rebuilt, as they were by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, the controversial architect, about 150 years ago.  will resist the easy symbolism of our past glory going to ashes, as well as the nauseating conspiracy theories which will undoubtedly flourish on the web.Notre-Dame de Paris will survive, and most of its treasures. But our hearts will bleed for ever."}
